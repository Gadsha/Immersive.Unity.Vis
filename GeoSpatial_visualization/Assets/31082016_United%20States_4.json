But the most significant part of his work as a composer is represented by his lyrics.&quot; - Martin Pillsbury, Ritmo Brasileiro.On his new release Minh&#39; Alma Nua (My Nude Soul), Fernando Holz sings and orchestrates original Brazilian pop-jazz music that makes the listener feel that he or she is being spoken to personally. The Boston-based musician from the south of Brazil by way of Europe melds happiness and sadness in superior material with an uncommon ease. Poetry is achieved through his sensitive and careful employment of mood, tempo, melody, and harmony. Never stilted or weak in sentiment, the music makes connections with that of the master, Tom Jobim. A native of Rio Grande do Sul,Brazil, Holz first made a favorable impression on the New England music scene as the vocalist with the popular quintet Gandaya, which created &quot;Brazilian music with a great deal of heart and soul, and not afraid to take a chance or two,&quot; - Jeff Turton, WFNX-Radio. He appeared at the Boston-area&#39;s premier jazz rooms Scullers and The Regattabar. as well as at the Hartford Jazz Festival before disbanding in the &#39;90s. He&#39;s also displayed his sizable musical talent with the Rio Show Band, with Banda Aue, and with Duo Bossa Rio.

their momentous journey in the past year and a half, and having unquestionably established themselves as the premiere live group on the reggae circuit, Morgan Heritage is now on another phase of their indomitable mission. The Royal Family of Reggae, has taken the impressively significant step forward by releasing their upcoming album, Strictly Roots. Guided by sheer acumen and a passionate desire to make their already rich musical legacy even more impactful, Morgan Heritage, after much deliberation and contemplation, triumphantly delivers their latest album exclusively on their very own label CTBC (Cool To Be Conscious) Music Group. Undoubtedly one of contemporary reggae&#39;s most powerful forces on the global stage, the sensational roots reggae quintet, which comprises siblings Peetah Morgan (vocals), Una Morgan (keyboard/vocals), Roy &quot;Gramps&quot; Morgan (keyboard/vocals), Nakhamyah &quot;Lukes&quot; Morgan (rhythm guitar) and Memmalatel &quot;Mr. Mojo&quot; Morgan (percussion/vocals) has embraced the challenges that come with empowerment of this nature.According to Gramps, &quot;Strictly Roots, our 10th studio album is particularly significant. It represents our first album released independent of VP Records, on our very own label CTBC Music Group. VP has been great for the group and we&#39;re grateful for our years with them. We just felt it was time to approach the release of our music differently.&quot;Possessing that unmistakably authentic Morgan Heritage organic roots sound with an expansively eclectic mix that takes it seamlessly into hybrid valleys and mountains, Strictly Roots interestingly pays homage to the elders, while ironically, also blazes the trail towards the exciting future of roots. &quot;We know what our fans want; we know exactly where we want to take them and we know precisely how to get them there,&quot; shrewd lead singer, Peetah Morgan, says confidently of the ground-breaking album which is set for a Spring release. Among the heavyweight co-producers with Morgan Heritage on Strictly Roots are Don Chandler and BBC One/BBC 1Xtra&#39;s Seani B who co-produced the compelling lead single, Perform and Done which is now available on iTunes; Shane C. Brown(Juke Boxx Productions); multiple Grammy nominee, Jason &quot;J-Vibe&quot; Farmer; French reggae/dancehall production duo MatthieuBost and Jrmie &quot;Bim&quot; Dessus; guitarist Andrew &quot;Simmo&quot; Simpson and DJ Fras. Contributing to the brilliant instrumentation for which a Morgan Heritage album is renowned, is multi-faceted studio and touring drummer, American Gil Sharone, whose DVD, Wicked Beats, incorporating ska, rocksteady and reggae, won the Drummie Award in Drum Magazine for &quot;DVD of the Year&quot; in 2011.Adding their vocals to infectious rhythms with empowering and stimulating lyrics are platinum selling Pop/Dancehall phenomenon Shaggy; American reggae and R&B vocalist, J Boog; third generation ambassadors from the Morgan and the Marley families, Jemere Morgan and Jo Mersa Marley; reggae sensation, Chronixx; rock, world and reggae band, Rebelution and Bumble Bee from the American Grammy-nominated pop reggae band SOJA.Like its predecessor, Here Come The Kings, Strictly Roots successfully incorporates R&B and a hint of dancehall, but it goes a step further with this synergy and almost effortlessly fuses a type of roots, pop and dancehall majesty that could only be truly achieved by the Royal Family of Reggae.","modified":"2016-08-08 10:50:45","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"morganheritage","linker":"evdb","name":"Morgan Heritage","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Morgan-Heritage?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000067078-3","short_bio":"Reggae Band"}},"title":"Morgan Heritage","venue_address":"13 NW 6th Avenue","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/551/722-1.jpeg_/morgan-heritage-22.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/000/551/722-1.jpeg_/morgan-heritage-22.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/551/722-1.jpeg_/morgan-heritage-22.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s3.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/000/551/722-1.jpeg_/morgan-heritage-22.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-06-09 20:53:30","venue_id":"V0-001-001620688-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Star Theater","venue_url":"http://portland.eventful.com/venues/star-theater-/V0-001-001620688-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Chicago","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"AL","postal_code":"35401","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"33.2113126","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/tuscaloosa/events/open-mic-night-/E0-001-094553672-0@2016083120?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-094553672-0@2016083120","privacy":"1","city_name":"Tuscaloosa","link_count":null,"longitude":"-87.5664931","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Alabama","start_time":"2016-08-31 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":null,"modified":"2016-06-26 13:06:37","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Open Mic Night","venue_address":"2209 Fourth Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":"on various days","calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2016-06-26 12:03:50","venue_id":"V0-001-000621621-3","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Little Willie's","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/tuscaloosa/venues/little-willies-/V0-001-000621621-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"FL","postal_code":"32301","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"30.4179","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/tallahassee/events/techyes-standard-ft-ard-/E0-001-095754973-6@2016083121?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095754973-6@2016083121","privacy":"1","city_name":"Tallahassee","link_count":null,"longitude":"-84.2576","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Florida","start_time":"2016-08-31 21:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" The Standard Presents:..:: TECHYES ::..First off, BIG thank you to everyone who came out to our first edition; what a night!  We recevied an overwhelming amount of positive feedback.  We couldn&#39;t wait any longer to do another.  This time we are reaching out a little further west to bring some of the finest talent of the current underground scene.Our second edition features:Ardalan (Dirtybird/This Ain&#39;t Bristol)https://soundcloud.com/ardalannhttps://www.facebook.com/ardalanmusicpagehttps://twitter.com/Ardalanderhttps://www.beatport.com/artist/ardalan/147723 Range, appeal and a massive dose of nasty, gritty bass arethe three chief weapons every Dirtybird artist has in hisquiver, but Ardalan seems to be the peak culmination of allthose assets in one wieldy point. This young archer has hadthe incomprehensible luck to fall into crew with his idols, bereared by their best and given some of their most guardedmusical secrets, then hoisted to a platform to blare hisprodigious beats from places where most creators can onlydream of being.Born in Tehran, Iran, Ardalan possesses a peculiar, freshperspective on music genesis without even trying. His mixes,remixes and dubs are known for their sass, energy andwickedly wry samples that snap like a wet towel to the face,but his original records are where his efforts shine, like thosereleased with Justin Martin —“Mr. Spock,” a 2010 partyanthem charted by Diplo and Jesse Rose, “LEZGO,” chartedby Dog Blood (Skrillex and Boyz Noise) and “Function”, the2015 banger that keeps giving — as well as two of his ownEP’s that were released on Dirtybird, “The Yeah / No” and“Thunderdad”. It is no wonder he has been given the nod byeveryone, from Papa Dirtybird himself (Claude VonStroke)and A-Trak, to those who are charting his remixes, like MayaJane Coles, Audiojack, and Riva Starr.The greatest strength in Ardy’s music is his ability to whip outhits that work equally well from the dankest basements to themost opulent dance-floors; sounds that satisfy those withdiverse tastes who can unite under his single agenda ofhaving a good time.Support By:HBK (Perfect Driver/Sleazy G/Mos Geygst)https://soundcloud.com/hbkmusic1 Burger Alert  https://soundcloud.com/burgeralertPandad https://soundcloud.com/pandad Sweezy https://soundcloud.com/swezzzey Hosted By:PRESSURE  ::Drink Specials::2 Free kegs | First come first serve$1 drinks till 11pm,$2 till 12am, $3 from 12-2am. ::Fun & Stuff::3 N64&#39;s & 1 Super Nintendo w/ access to Mario Kart 64, Super Smash Bros, Mortal Kombat I, II, & III, Street fighter II, NFL Blitz, Golden Eye, Pokemon Stadium, NBA Jam, Madden, Killer Instinct, WCW/ NWA Revenge. 3 Classic movies playing on the big screen projector AGES: 18+ | NO REFUNDS | ALL SALES FINAL ","modified":"2016-08-29 05:54:15","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Techyes @ The Standard ft.
