TA$C!ONE started playing various instruments at a young age including the piano and the guitar. He comes from a long line of musicians with family members having played alongside acts like Frank Sinatra, Van Morrison, Tina Tuner, Elton John, Eric Clapton, and more. In High School he started film editing and music production without a clue as to what he was really doing. It wasn&#39;t until his college years that he buckled down, and hit production really hard, but he hasn&#39;t looked back since. A relative newcomer to the scene, T$! has already garnered support from industry leading producers, blogs, and labels. Following the success of his Beatport charting single &quot;Real Street&quot;, a collaboration with industry heavy hitter Prismo, he&#39;s continued to strike while the iron is hot with big remixes and originals.

Oscar-winning filmmaker Neville (TWENTY FEET FROM STARDOM) is especially adept at presenting both the music and the stories behind the music, and this enchanting documentary is no exception. It begins with a rousing open-air concert in a public square in Istanbul, then sketches in the biography of Ma (including a wonderful clip of the seven-year-old prodigy performing at the Kennedy White House) and the evolution of the Ensemble. It proceeds to interweave the back stories of selected Ensemble members (often survivors of political oppression), including Iranian exile Kayhan Kalhor, master of the kamancheh, or Persian spiked fiddle, and Cristina Pato, a green-haired. rock-starlike bagpiper known as “the Jimi Hendrix of Galicia.” DCP digital.
