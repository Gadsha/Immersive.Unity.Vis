With their original tracks this year seemingly ubiquitous across Beatport charts and clubland alike, their rise to success has been swift and unrepentant.

Support has risen rapidly, with regular coverage across Radio one&#39;s full spectrum of dance shows; notably Pete Tong, Annie Mac and Danny Howard airing pretty much everything that comes from their Brighton studio, and DJs like Nic Fanciulli, Carl Cox, Joris Voorn, Loco Dice, Joseph Capriati, Hot Since 82, Mark Knight & more all professing to heavy rotation of their addictive club cuts in their sets. This hype and consistency has earned them the respect to grace some of the finest Dancefloors and festivals in the world including Space Ibiza, Sankeys, Amnesia, Ministry of Sound, Spy Bar Chicago and Ultra Music Festival, EDC, Sunburn, BPM Mexico and Sensation White. Their journey began as 2 vinyl junkies crate digging for hidden house gems, they share a mutual love of house music that has spawned the infectious trademark groove they&#39;ve become so renowned for. Their debut production &#39;Outro Lugar&#39; was picked up by Roger Sanchez&#39;s legendary Stealth imprint and branded an Ibiza weapon 2 summers running. That barged the flood gates open to a wave of triumphant remixes: notably Cevin Fisher&#39;s classic &#39;Burning up&#39; and Golden Girls Kinetic, both quickly securing dance floor anthem status the world over, and racking them up credible list of collaborations and remixes which includes the likes of Green Velvet, Ben Westbeach, Moby, Dosem, Todd Terry, Roger Sanchez, and Mark Knight. Meanwhile their explosive studio output has generated yet more demand for forthcoming EP&#39;s on heavyweight labels Suara, Relief, Lapsus, Stereo Recordings and they&#39;re only just scratching the surface. Working their magic with Mark Knight in the studio and mixing the Toolroom live albums has made them favourites among the label die hards selling out their events worldwide.","modified":"2018-09-04 19:18:43","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Prok & Fitch","venue_address":"314 11th Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"//d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/041/318/933-1.jpeg_/prok-fitch-33.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"//d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/medium/I0-001/041/318/933-1.jpeg_/prok-fitch-33.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"//d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/041/318/933-1.jpeg_/prok-fitch-33.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"//d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/thumb/I0-001/041/318/933-1.jpeg_/prok-fitch-33.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2018-08-08 23:58:51","venue_id":"V0-001-010729438-5","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Halcyon","venue_url":"http://sanfrancisco.eventful.com/venues/halcyon-/V0-001-010729438-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Los_Angeles","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CA","postal_code":"90028","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"34.1010258","groups":null,"url":"http://losangeles.eventful.com/events/sound-presents-juan-maclean-dj-set-ray-kash-/E0-001-118440720-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-118440720-8","privacy":"1","city_name":"Los Angeles","link_count":null,"longitude":"-118.3360313","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"California","start_time":"2018-09-28 22:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" JUAN MACLEAN Juan MacLean is an eclectic and prolific Brooklyn based DJ and producer who has been both a NYC and international fixture for over 15 years. www.instagram.com/thejuanmaclean/www.facebook.com/thejuanmaclean/www.twitter.com/juanmaclean/www.soundcloud.com/the-juan-maclean/ RAY KASH Founder of longstanging LA party, Temple Tuesdays, Ray Kash is a staple in the underground house music scene in NY and LA, and we&#39;re excited to have him opening for Juan Maclean this Friday. https://www.facebook.com/dj.raykashhttps://www.twitter.com/raykashmusichttps://www.soundcloud.com/raykashhttps://www.instagram.com/raygasm ","modified":"2018-09-25 19:38:19","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"jedidiah","linker":"evdb","name":"The Juan Maclean","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/The-Juan-Maclean?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000020862-9","short_bio":"Electronic musician"}},"title":"Sound presents Juan Maclean (DJ Set) & Ray Kash","venue_address":"1642 Las Palmas Avenue","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/000/289/098-3.jpg_/the-juan-maclean-98.jpg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/medium/I0-001/000/289/098-3.jpg_/the-juan-maclean-98.jpg","height":"128"},"url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/000/289/098-3.jpg_/the-juan-maclean-98.jpg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/thumb/I0-001/000/289/098-3.jpg_/the-juan-maclean-98.jpg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2018-09-25 19:38:19","venue_id":"V0-001-006593726-1","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Sound Nightclub","venue_url":"http://losangeles.eventful.com/venues/sound-nightclub-/V0-001-006593726-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Los_Angeles","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CA","postal_code":"92627","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"33.6430913","groups":null,"url":"http://orangecounty.eventful.com/events/till-dawn-group-presents-6lack-/E0-001-118203475-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-118203475-2","privacy":"1","city_name":"Costa Mesa","link_count":null,"longitude":"-117.9172914","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"California","start_time":"2018-09-28 22:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" For Guaranteed Entry, purchase your presale tickets.

Infamous Angel, initially issued on Rounder in 1992, before being picked up by Warner Bros., immediately established her as a promising and talented artist. Its 1994 follow-up, My Life, earned a Grammy nomination in the Contemporary Folk category and her 1996 album, The Way I Should, which addressed political, as well as personal themes, brought her a second nomination.<p><p>Along the way, several of DeMent’s songs became cultural touchstones. “Let The Mystery Be” found its way to MTV Unplugged as a duet by David Byrne and Natalie Merchant. “Our Town” was played over the farewell scene in the series finale of Northern Exposure. Merle Haggard, invited her to tour with his legendary band “The Strangers,” sitting in as piano player and later went on to record two of her songs, “No Time To Cry” and the gospel tinged “The Shores of Jordan”. She’s recorded and toured extensively with John Prine, singing four duets with him on “In Spite of Ourselves”, and had a minor role in the motion picture “Songcatcher”, as well as contributing a song to its soundtrack.<p><p>In 2004 she recorded the gospel album, Lifeline. “I took a bunch of old church songs I love...songs I’ve sung since as far back as I can remember, and sat down at a worn out, warbly piano with some tape rolling.” One of the songs caught on that tape, was her rendition of “Leaning on the Everlasting Arms,” the song the Coen Brothers, in 2010, chose to run over the closing credits of their remake of the classic western “True Grit.”<p><p>As with Lifeline, DeMent released her latest album, Sing The Delta on her own label, Flariella Records in 2012. Co-produced with Richard Bennett and Bo Ramsey, Sing The Delta was lauded by fans and critics far and wide: The Boston Globe called it “a work of rare, unvarnished grace and power”; Rolling Stone noted “these artisanal songs of love and doubt wear their homeliness proudly; the effect is like finding a bountiful farmstand in the middle of nowhere”. And, as in her earlier releases, Sing The Delta was praised by the folks at NPR, among them Ken Tucker who said “the songs on Sing The Delta only grow more rich, more emotionally complex, the more you hear them.<p><p>And now, 23 years after her debut album “Infamous Angel”, DeMent is busy preparing for the August release of her latest work “The Trackless Woods”, a collection of 18 poems written by the late Russian poet Anna Akhmatova and set to music by DeMent. More on that to come!<p><p>DeMent continues to tour extensively, singing the songs she loves: “My mom, who sang all the time, straight up to the end, said to me one day, not long before she died: “singin’ is prayin’. Even though I’m not religious in the way I was brought up to be, I understand what she meant. That’s what it feels like for me, too. We’re always linked to things bigger than ourselves but when I’m singing is when I most know that. It’s a good place to go...as often as possible!”</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>","modified":"2018-05-21 19:49:04","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"drolston","linker":"evdb","name":"Iris DeMent","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Iris-DeMent?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000043265-1","short_bio":"iIris Dement"}},"title":"Iris DeMent - 9/28/18","venue_address":"1350 Okie St NE","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/000/828/845-4.jpeg_/iris-dement-45.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/medium/I0-001/000/828/845-4.jpeg_/iris-dement-45.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/000/828/845-4.jpeg_/iris-dement-45.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/thumb/I0-001/000/828/845-4.jpeg_/iris-dement-45.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2018-05-21 19:49:04","venue_id":"V0-001-012763800-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"City Winery","venue_url":"http://washingtondc.eventful.com/venues/city-winery-/V0-001-012763800-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Denver","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CO","postal_code":"80127","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"39.569878","groups":null,"url":"http://denver.eventful.com/events/denvers-hottest-old-school-funk-and-rb-band-/E0-001-118431575-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-118431575-8","privacy":"1","city_name":"Littleton","link_count":null,"longitude":"-105.112153","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Colorado","start_time":"2018-09-28 21:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":"The Jakarta Band™ plays a variety of music from disco, soul and hip-hop to soft rock.For the past 35 years, Isaac Points has been creating the groove that gets people on the dance floor.

Open to the public - a very nice event. ___________________________________ <b>FAQ:</b> <b>What is the Steel guitar showcase?</b> Musicians sign up to play a 25 min. set of steel guitar. It&#39;s kind of like an open stage but pre-planned, with assigned playing slots each day. HSGA members get priority on all showcase stages, non-members will be assigned a slot to play once all members have been scheduled. (Join HSGA today for only $30!) ALL styles are welcome, but you will hear a lot of Hawaiian music. This is typically not a pedal steel showcase. The art of Hawaiian-style steel playing on electric lap steels, resonator guitars, and acoustic instruments is the main focus of our event and organization. You will be asked what time slot you&#39;d like to play during checkout on this website. We want you to share your music! <b>What is the Luau?</b> A luau will be held on Saturday night with a Polynesian-style dinner, cash bar, and show - $50 per person. Excellent food, and Hawaiian entertainment. <b>I need Hotel Reservations, is that included?</b> Hotel reservations must be made separately. They can be made by calling the Fort Collins Hilton at (970) 482-2626 - mention the HSGA Hawaiian Festival for special block room rates. OR reserve your rooms online <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/HSGA2018-HiltonRes\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Hilton HSGA reservations. </a> <b>What is the Playing Schedule?</b> Schedule posted at <a href=\"http://hsga.org/festival2018.htm#players\" rel=\"nofollow\">HSGA.org website.</a> Please note that you will be asked for your stage time slot preferences during checkout on this website. We encourage you to play! We want you to share your music. Playing slots are assigned on a first-come-first-served basis. We&#39;ll try and take your preferences into account. All stage playing slots are planned and scheduled by the festival committee. If you want to do a set on stage during the weekend, please sign up as you purchase your ticket here (you&#39;ll see the sign up form during the checkout), or check the HSGA website for sign up information that you can print and mail it. A paper registration form will be mailed to all members in the next newsletter. All players will have 25 minutes to perform, and must bring at least two sets of charts for the backup musicians. You will need to round up your own backup folks from volunteers at the festival. Don&#39;t worry - there will be many folks willing to play guitar, or uke or bass for you. Or you can bring your own backup folks. AND, all performers MUST purchase either a day or weekend pass. <b>What AIRPORT do I fly into?</b> DIA in Denver is the fly-to location. Many options exist out of DIA for transport to Ft. Collins. There are shuttle services, and rental cars. We recommend <a href=\"http://www.greenrideco.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Ride out of Ft. Collins.</a> <b>Can I join HSGA?</b> Please consider becoming a member if you are not. Visit <a href=\"http://www.hsga.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">HSGA.org</a> to sign up. Membership gets you a regular quarterly newsletter, priority for stage time at Ft. Collins, and really nice price breaks at our biennial convention event in Honolulu. Next one in 2019. <b>What to Bring?</b> The stages will have backline amps, so bring your instrument, cables to plug in, tuner, charts for backup players, your good self and a smile. Colorado in the early Fall can have dramatic weather changes, but it&#39;s usually warm during the day, and cold at night. Bring a warm coat if you want to explore the mountains and foothills trails close to town. Elevation in Ft. Collins is 4,982 ft above sea level. <br> <br> \n","modified":"2018-09-21 02:38:31","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Hawaiian Steel Guitar Festival 2018","venue_address":"Fort Collins, Colorado, United States","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-02-12 04:59:27","venue_id":"V0-001-000307835-7","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2018-09-29 22:00:00","venue_name":"Fort Collins, Colorado, United States","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/fortcollins/venues/fort-collins-colorado-united-states-/V0-001-000307835-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Chicago","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"IL","postal_code":"60647","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"41.9317583","groups":null,"url":"http://chicago.eventful.com/events/trial-errorgood-3-/E0-001-118237321-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-118237321-7","privacy":"1","city_name":"Chicago","link_count":null,"longitude":"-87.7136441","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Illinois","start_time":"2018-09-28 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" This is the third iteration of endeavors into trials and reaping or learning from their errors and goods.

RESIDENTS:<br> MATT MAIN<br> VICTOR VEGA<br> BRENDAN FINLAYSON<br><br> MATT MAIN<br> Raised in the outer badlands of Chicago and upon his migration to the home of House Music was educated in the boompty-bass school of hard knocks, forming him into the funk-doc, soul controller of the dance-floor that he is today. From in the cut is where he launches his schemes for dance-floor obliteration and only in the moment of truth will you ever really see Matt Main lose his cool as it is poured through the speakers and into your body. Time and place has no bearing on his agenda as his singular purpose at the controls is to funk you, bang you and bounce you with an eclectic range of techno and house tracks.<br> Matt Main not only hatches his plans for the dance-floor from behind the decks but also from behind the scenes as a key component of the No Affiliation parties that helped set the highest standards for underground events in Chicago. His time running boards and doing production for some of Chicago’s largest festivals and events has allowed him to bring a level of technical proficiency to his own events and mix. Whether at work or play Matt Main’s life is shrouded in perfecting the organized noise that is so often bringing people to various states of sweaty elation.<br> Currently residing in Oakland, Matt has shifted his focus to the studio since his migration out west in 2015. Still a relatively unknown entity in the Bay Area it’s only a matter of time before the word is out and his new home can embrace his renegade sound.<br> https://hearthis.at/mattmain/<br> https://soundcloud.com/matt-main<br><br> Victor Vega<br> Hailing from Jersey City via Northampton, has been part of the dance-music culture for the past 15 years studying media production, promotion, and learning the music. In 2004, Victor moved from Massachusetts to California to further his knowledge of event and music production, promotion, and DJing.<br> Some of Victor’s early dance influences were genres such as Latin and Acid House, Hip-Hop, R ’n’ B, World Beat music and such unlikely sounds as Classical and Classic Rock. During the last two and one-half years, Vega has honed his craft of sculpting the sounds of Deep, Tech House, keeping it dirty and juicy so that it makes you want to freaky deaky.<br> In moving to San Francisco and working with the Fringe Art Collective and Janky barge. Victor has enjoyed the honor of playing alongside artists such as The Juan McLain, Freestylers, Bassnectar, BLVD, Glitch Mob, Stanton Warriors, and DJ Icey in venues such as Poleng Lounge, Anu, Mighty, Rain Dance (Santa Cruz), Get Freaky @ 10:15, Burning Man, and Decompression. Victor continues his quest for the last Five years with the Housepitality Crew as resident and floor manager.<br> In the coming years, Victor will be focusing further on music production and in utilizing more hardware technology to extend the fluidity of the mix, and continuing his quest for excellence in event-production for the ever-demanding public. Meanwhile, Vega hasn’t lost sight of the point of all this which is to bring people together to share common interests and participate in the evolution of the culture and, most importantly, shake thy butt.<br> https://soundcloud.com/victorvegamusic<br><br> Brendan Finlayson<br> Mostly deep house and techno.<br> https://soundcloud.com/brendanfin <br><br> Proximity is a side project that Victor Vega & wife Laura Vega have been developing for the past year and a half.

Kicking it off with a release on Shall Not Fade’s sister label Lost Palms, Hallis released two further EPs on LPH White and E-Beamz, the label that mothered his debut. You can catch him throughout the last quarter of 2017 at a string of DJ performances alongside the likes of Palms Trax, DJ Seinfeld and Julio Bashmore throughout Europe.<br> He’ll also be playing at The Marble Factory for Shall Not Fade’s In:Motion showcase. Proving why his talent as a DJ is just as great as that of his productions, he’s picked out today’s Tracks Of The Day. Trust me, they are far from boring.<br><br> https://www.residentadvisor.net/dj/djboring<br> https://soundcloud.com/djboring1990<br><br> Supporting DJ BORING are Re:Set (Boston)&#39;s own Matt Foley and CreateSpace Collab&#39;s Trip Report<br><br> In the lounge party vibes from Matt and Alfredo.<br><br> Tickets are in the link.
