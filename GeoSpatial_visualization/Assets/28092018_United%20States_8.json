He performs in a host of creative projects including Atlantis Quartet, winner of the 2015 McKnight Fellowship and named 2011 Best Jazz Artist, as well as the Zacc Harris Group, American Reverie, and Zacc Harris Trio. <br><br>Harris has toured as leader and sideman throughout the US and UK, including a 2016 run with Zacc Harris Group at London&#39;s famed Ronnie Scott&#39;s Jazz Club. Jazz Improv Magazine says, &quot;Harris delivers a sound that is lucid, clear...providing rich-sounding accompaniment, and well-crafted solos&quot; while Cadence Magazine calls some of Harris&#39; work on Atlantis Quartet&#39;s most recent album &quot;worthy of John McLaughlin.&quot; MPR News states, &quot;Harris makes his own mark on standards with enough new hooks to keep jazz alive.&quot;<br><br>In 2012, Harris released his first album as leader, THE GARDEN, on Shifting Paradigm Records. City Pages writer Rick Mason says, &quot;The Garden showcases Harris&#39;s compositions, which adeptly and compellingly link the past and future of jazz, and guitar work, which is consistently articulate with an enticing fluidity seemingly influenced by the likes of Wes Montgomery and Pat Metheny.&quot; The American Composers Forum chose Harris for one of its three Minnesota Emerging Composers Awards in 2016, to write and record a second album with this group in 2017. <br><br>Zacc is also a busy sideman, having performed and recorded with countless artists, including Debbie Duncan, Bruce Henry, Babatunde Lea, Eric Gravatt, Ben Wendel, Michael Janisch, and Nancy Harms.

songs are unfailingly melodic, brisk and buoyant, powered by her reassuring, wisdom-soaked vocals and ever-present fiddle and accordion. Puryear&#39;s songs accentuate the groove, his exceptional guitar work and sly, Dylan-like way with lyrics.&quot; New Haven Register expands upon this to say, “Donna the Buffalo knows a thing or two about rhythm. Cajun, zydeco and old-time rhythms. A bit of reggae rhythm. Various guitar and fiddle rhythms. The rhythm of traveling by bus year after year for more than a quarter-century now, criss-crossing America… over and over again.” Donna the Buffalo is Jeb Puryear (vocals, electric guitar) and Tara Nevins (vocals, fiddle, guitar, accordion, scrubboard) joined by David McCracken (B3 Hammond organ, Hohner Clavinet & piano), Kyle Spark (bass) and Mark Raudabaugh (drums). “It&#39;s been really fun with this lineup,” Puryear says. “You get to the point where you&#39;re playing on a really high level, things are clicking and it&#39;s like turning on the key to a really good car. It just goes.” Donna the Buffalo drew its original inspiration from a cherished part of the American heritage: the old-time music festivals of the south that drew entire towns and counties together. Not only was it playing music at these events, it was the vibe and the togetherness that bonded the people that attended. “Those festivals were so explosive, and the community and the feeling of people being with each other, that&#39;s the feeling we were shooting for in our music.” Puryear says, “Donna the Buffalo is an extension of the joy we&#39;ve found.” &quot;It’s a great feeling to promote such a feeling of community, like you’re really part of something that’s happening, like a movement or a positive force…” Nevins says. “All those people that come and follow you and you recognize them and you become friends with them — you’re all moving along for the same purpose. It is powerful. It’s very powerful, actually.” Donna the Buffalo has released ten albums and are affiliated with several others, including Puryear’s 2007 solo album Hopes and Dreams and a 2003 release, Wait Til Spring, with Jim Lauderdale. The band&#39;s 2008 release Silverlined, as well as the 2013 release, Tonight, Tomorrow and Yesterday, (both on Sugar Hill Records) did well on the Americana Music Chart, each placing well into the top ten. In 2011 Nevins released Wood and Stone, produced by Larry Campbell in Levon Helm Studios, and Mule to Ride in 1999 on Sugar Hill Records. “Though it will always be hard to pinpoint the key to an act’s staying power, distinctiveness and consistency surely can’t hurt.” Pittsburgh City Paper says, “Donna the Buffalo has carved out a niche; it has weathered trends, and even made some of its own by being unapologetically itself.” “Donna The Buffalo is from central New York state, not Louisiana, but this widely loved quintet has woven that joyful, hip-shaking zydeco pulse into the DNA of its sound, and leaders Jeb Puryear and Tara Nevins have wrapped that core vibe with hopeful, mellow lyrics.” --Music City Roots, Craig Havighurst “For the dizzying array of styles and genres with which they work, Donna The Buffalo maintain a surprising level of consistency. The New York-based band has played around with folk, zydeco, and many other musical ideas over the course of their.. career, but they retain a sharp focus that has helped them create some truly lasting music.” --Elmore Magazine.

Now, “Standing in the Shadows” of Levi’s Love, are 5 members of his family who carry that magical DNA -but have created a sound and a singing legacy all their own. The Stubbs Girls are a Detroit-based vocal quintet that consists of Levi Stubbs&#39; sister, Thelma, and her fournieces – Robin, Pamela, Sheila, and Ronda. The girls not only share musical backgrounds from Motownand Gospel but they all have the same vocal timbre, which results in uniquely rich harmonies whenever theysing. It’s what gives them their distinctive sound and identity. The musical origins of the Stubbs Girls go back to 1980 when three of the girls formed a singing group called “Starfire” and performed for 8 years at popular Detroit nightclubs like Henry’s, Baker’s Keyboard Lounge, Club Mozambique, and The Roostertail. During those early years, they received generous advice from their Uncle Levi as well as Uncle Joe Stubbs of the Falcons to help polish their performance skills.  In 1989, the girls reorganized under the name “Phase III” and continued to perform. In 1994 they formed “Guest Stars Inc.”, to showcase their musical talents to various community organizations in other cities.  In 2005, the girls created the group, “The Stubbs Girls”, to brand that famous name. For the next several years they were regular performers on The Detroit Princess cruise ship and then served as featured entertainers on The Murder Mystery Train.  In 2009, William Guest – noted singer for Gladys Knight and the Pips – signed The Stubbs Girls to a record deal on his Atlanta label, Crew Records. Their debut album was a self-titled CD consisting of 13 songs with rich harmonies and catchy melodies. It was well received. With their new tracks in hand, the girls hit the road and began landing gigs at major venues like DTE Energy Theatre, Chene Park Amphitheater, The Sound Board Theatre, The Kellogg Theatre, The Roostertail, and The Detroit Institute of Arts. They opened for the likes of The Four Tops, The Reflections, Shades of Blue, Enchantment, The Mary Jane Girls, and even Phyllis Hyman. They also toured at popular venues in Ohio, Maryland, Arizona, Georgia, Kentucky and Alabama.   In 2010, The Stubbs Girls appeared at DTE Energy Theatre, Music Hall and The Idlewild Music Festival.They also opened for The Four Tops & Temptations Show, The Contours, and Frankie Beverly & Maze.In 2011, they performed at several festivals and made stops in Indiana, Florida and Toronto, Canada. Thehighlight that year was singing The National Anthem at a Detroit Tigers game at Comerica Park.In 2012, The Stubbs Girls returned to Idlewild and The Sound Board Theatre, MGM Grand Casino andThe Motor City Casino. They also performed at The Motown Mansion and The Ribs & Soul Festival.In 2013, they opened for The Four Tops, The Dramatics, Martha Reeves, and Gene Chandler and werefeatured performers at the R&B Hall of Fame Ceremonies and The Detroit Black Music Awards Gala.In recent years, The Stubbs Girls appeared at The Rancho Fiesta Casino in Las Vegas, The Hard RockCafé in Atlanta, The Masonic Temple Theatre in Detroit, and the R&B Hall of Fame Induction Ceremonieshosted by Mary Wilson of The Supremes.

A quartet of Southern rock traditionalists from Nashville, the Steel Woods lay claim to the sound pioneered by Lynyrd Skynyrd. Like Skynyrd, The Steel Woods balance heavy blues-rock with Southern poetry, and they add a bit of plainspoken outlaw country to the mix, as evidenced on their 2017 debut, Straw in the Wind. Prior to forming the Steel Woods, guitarists Wes Bayliss and Jason &quot;Rowdy&quot; Cope were both pursuing musical careers. Cope found work as a session musician and played in Jamey Johnson&#39;s band, but once he met Bayliss at a Nashville gig, the two clicked. First they became friends, then they wound collaborating, adding bassist Johnny Stanton and drummer Jay Tooke to round out the lineup. An eponymous EP came out in 2016, and the next year saw the release of Straw in the Wind on Thirty Tigers/Woods Music.<br> <br> \n","modified":"2018-06-28
