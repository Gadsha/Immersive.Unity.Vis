<p><strong></strong><p><strong>$32 Advance | $37 Day of Show</strong><p><strong>Doors open at 7pm. Jamie Kent starts the show at 8pm!</strong><p><strong>Paul Thorn</strong> has created an innovative and impressive career, pleasing crowds with his muscular brand of roots music – bluesy, rocking and thoroughly Southern American, yet also speaking universal truths. Among those who value originality, inspiration, eccentricity and character – as well as talent that hovers somewhere on the outskirts of genius, the story of Paul Thorn is already familiar. Raised in Tupelo, Mississippi, among the same spirits (and some of the actual people) who nurtured the young Elvis generations before, Paul Thorn has rambled down back roads and jumped out of airplanes, worked for years in a furniture factory, battled four-time world champion boxer Roberto Duran on national television, signed with and been dropped by a major label, performed on stages with Bonnie Raitt, Mark Knopfler, Sting, and John Prine among many others, and made some of the most emotionally restless yet fully accessible music of our time.<p>He’s also appeared on major television shows such as Late Night with Conan O’Brien and Jimmy Kimmel Live, been the subject of numerous National Public Radio (NPR) features and charted multiple times on the Billboard Top 100 and Americana Radioi Charts.<p>This year, Paul will be releasing an album titled Don’t Let the Devil Ride, which he describes as “the culmination of my whole life in music, coming back to my roots.” It marks his first time recording gospel music - featuring guests such as the Blind Boys of Alabama, the McCrary Sisters, and Preservation Hall Horns - and his creation of a body of strikingly original songs that address the foibles of human relationships without necessarily favoring the sacred over the profane.<p><strong>About the opener, Neal McCarthy: </strong><p><p>Neal is a local legend logging over 20 years in the local scene playing all over New England. He is equally adept at rock, blues, and country.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>","modified":"2018-09-15 06:47:47","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Paul Thorn Band","venue_address":"16 Anawan Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-03-31 06:58:01","venue_id":"V0-001-000155920-1","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Narrows Center for the Arts","venue_url":"http://providence.eventful.com/venues/the-narrows-center-for-the-arts-/V0-001-000155920-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Phoenix","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"AZ","postal_code":"85054","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"33.6762596","groups":null,"url":"http://phoenix.eventful.com/events/david-arnold-tickets-16-e-/E0-001-117391970-7@2018092819?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-117391970-7@2018092819","privacy":"1","city_name":"Phoenix","link_count":null,"longitude":"-111.9654119","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Arizona","start_time":"2018-09-28 19:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":null,"modified":"2018-08-24 03:22:04","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"chuck","linker":"evdb","name":"David Arnold","url":"http://eventful.com/performers/david-arnold-/P0-001-000105852-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000105852-6","short_bio":"Stand-up Comedian"}},"title":"David Arnold Tickets (16+ Event)","venue_address":"5350 East High Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":"on various days","calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-08-24 03:22:03","venue_id":"V0-001-008511331-9","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"House of Comedy","venue_url":"http://phoenix.eventful.com/venues/house-of-comedy-/V0-001-008511331-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Indiana/Indianapolis","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"IN","postal_code":"10336","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"41.1793613","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/fortwayne/events/band-cheyenne-dustin-castle-/E0-001-118046669-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-118046669-2","privacy":"1","city_name":"Fort Wayne","link_count":null,"longitude":"-85.074339","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Indiana","start_time":"2018-09-28 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Crush House Recording Artist TBC Single Release and Fan Appreciation Party.

An albums undertaking can be an explosion or a slow burn. I spent almost five years creating, recording, arranging and performing the music on this record. Hundreds of hours were spent riding the bus to Clackamas Community College to access their wonderful recording tools and work with the amazing Sacha Müller. Over the years, I used Portlands incredible studios to record my talented friends, including the inspiring Esperanza Spalding. They dusted their magic on these songs; songs about women in my life like my beloved Grandma Mac on the cover, and songs for all the versions of myself that live in my head and heart, maturing and developing with each year of this project. This rare orchestral presentation is a dream come true, made possible through a RACC grant. It let me enlist a brass quartet, string trio and choir to bring the albums recorded textures to life. In a studio, anything is possible. You can create four-part french horn harmonies and play them all yourself (like I did) or sing an entire chorale (ditto). Now, 17 other musicians will come together on-stage to make my recordings a sonic reality. It means so much to be able to share this with you. This performance is made possible through a generous grant from the RACC. To listen to early releases from Women in My Head, find/follow Megan Diana on iTunes and Spotify. Nightride, the most recent release featuring Esperanza Spalding on bass, is track #1 for this years PDX POP NOW! compilation.<br> <br> \n","modified":"2018-08-21 03:14:44","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"TOC Presents Megan Diana - \"Woman In My Head\" Album Release w/Old Unconscious","venue_address":"1422 SW 11th Ave.","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-08-18 03:09:58","venue_id":"V0-001-000332434-4","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2018-09-28 22:00:00","venue_name":"The Old Church","venue_url":"http://portland.eventful.com/venues/the-old-church-/V0-001-000332434-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"PA","postal_code":"19104","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"39.9612181","groups":null,"url":"http://philadelphia.eventful.com/events/paul-j-baccash-/E0-001-116732156-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-116732156-7","privacy":"1","city_name":"Philadelphia","link_count":null,"longitude":"-75.1369106","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Pennsylvania","start_time":"2018-09-28 21:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Performing with Shorty Long & The Jersey Horns","modified":"2018-08-02 00:44:40","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Paul J Baccash","venue_address":"Delaware Ave","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-08-02 00:44:40","venue_id":"V0-001-004903884-3","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Sugarhouse Casino","venue_url":"http://philadelphia.eventful.com/venues/sugarhouse-casino-/V0-001-004903884-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"VA","postal_code":"20176","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"39.1092939","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/leesburg_va/events/scorpion-rose-/E0-001-115464216-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-115464216-9","privacy":"1","city_name":"Leesburg","link_count":null,"longitude":"-77.5506294","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Virginia","start_time":"2018-09-28 21:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" 9-1am!

Come on out to see all of these incredible musicians shredding faces off! Desiree&#39; Bassett: Throughout the years, she has performed with many outstanding and renowned musicians including Living Colour, Andy Aledort, Geraldo Velez, Jeff Baxter “Skunk”, members of the Allman Brothers Band, Sammy Hagar, Ted Nugent Marshall Tucker Band, Foghat, Barry Goudreau (formerly of the band Boston), and many more. With the explosion of the social media world, Desiree quickly became world-known through videos of her performances on MySpace, Facebook and YouTube. Desiree’ currently has 3 albums out (Power & Force, Power & Force II and A Bit Above) and has gone through a few tours: -Cirque du Soleil’s Michael Jackson the IMMORTAL World Tour (2011-2014) which featured some of Michael Jackson’s original band members and has gone around 27 different countries in 141 cities with over 500 performances, hitting the box offices of being the 7th highest grossing tour of over $374 million. -Blue Moon Tour with world renowned drummer Stacey Lamont Sydnor and world famous bassist Linley Marthe that took place in Europe in 4 different countries. -Jane Zhang&#39;s Bang The World Concert that featured two concerts in Jane’s hometown Chengdu, China. One concert featuring a very electrifying show of dance, pop, and electronic and another concert Jane Zhang and Friends that performed with a 90 piece orchestra and had featured world famous artists such as Chris Botti and John Legend. -The Legacy Tour featuring William Hall that is a totally dedicated, emotionally powerful driven show that tributes to the all time favorite Michael Jackson. The tour took place in Australia from May – July of 2016 and August – October of 2017 and Germany from September – October of 2016 and is still currently touring around the world. Currently, Desiree’ still continues to tour around the world while on her time off works on her 4th album and performs shows with her band Desiree&#39; & the Time Machine, a power trio that features her on lead guitar and vocals, Robert Gottfried on drums and Bob Laramie on bass, and a side project she occasionally performs with known as Siksay Band. Shadow Eden: Shadow Eden creates music that dazzles with virtuosity, ignites the senses, and pushes boundaries. Shadow Eden culminates the heralded talents of founding members David Mercado & drummer Kenny Lane, who joined by bassist extraordinaire Randy Coven in 2011 quickly became a mainstay of the Northeast circuit. Shadow Eden&#39;s self titled, self-financed and promoted ALL instrumental release, entered the regular rotation of national college radio stations entering the top 40 on the CMJ charts !! Shadow Eden began work on it&#39;s release in the Summer of 2013. &quot;Perpetual Motion,&quot; was completed in March of 2014 and soon thereafter the band began making preparations for a Summer release, which was tragically derailed by the untimely passing of Randy Coven. Confronted by overwhelming odds and pressure, in the face of the pending release, the band held auditions for a replacement. A fan of both Shadow Eden & The Mark Wood Experience introduced them to Mark Wood&#39;s bass player, Paul Ranieri. Ranieri, a masterful musician & Bass player, was the perfect fit for the musical pedigree of Shadow Eden, officially joining the band in July of 2014. Since it&#39;s founding in 2009, Shadow Eden has enjoyed great fortune, being propelled to the forefront of their genre by sheer musical prowess & determination, earning them the respect of their contemporaries and gaining them legions of new fans. In the words of The Metal Fields Kerb Vater, &quot; People who are interested in good instrumental work should give Shadow Eden a listen....&quot; A new chapter now begins....Dave, Paul & Claudio Joe Stump: Joe Stump (born September 18 , 1960) is an American guitarist and composer. He plays neo-classical metal, in a style similar to that of Yngwie Malmsteen. He has released albums with his band, Reign of Terror and as a solo artist. Stump is a professional shredder, and Guitar One Magazine voted him 6th position among the Top 10 fastest shredders of all time. Stump has taught for many years at the Berklee College of Music in Boston. He also plays the lead guitar for the symphonic metal band HolyHell","modified":"2018-04-05 14:10:39","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Desiree' Apolonio Bassett- SHADOW
