The Saint Joseph News Press described her performance of the Verdi Requiem as possessing &quot;amazingly powerful vocals displaying a &quot;simple, almost effortless, approach&quot;. Opera News Magazine said of her role as Mrs. Nolan in The Medium as a &quot;lustrous robust sound&quot;. At home on the opera, music theatre, and concert stages, Dr. Zaro&#39;s credits include San Francisco Opera, Eugene Opera, and various regional companies. She has performed with world-class conductors such as Henrich Hollreiser, Edo De Waart, Lamberto Gardelli, Garcia Navarro, and Brian Priestman.

In recent years, Dr. Zaro has enjoyed exploring and working in vocal jazz with pianist/arranger Lori Dokken. Recently, she recorded a jazz CD, Fly Home Little Heart, with the Laura Caviani Trio and was featured in an article by Andrea Canter as a Twin Cities up-and-coming jazz artist in the Jazz Police magazine. She has been a special guest on the KBEM FM Jazz 88.5 Maryanne Sullivan Show and NPR: All Things Considered for her work in jazz. In the Spring 2011 Dr. Zaro was an invited artist-in residence for the Minneapolis School District introducing jazz to intermediate school age children in a 10 week-workshop environment culminating in a greater Minneapolis school district jazz concert at the Ted Mann Concert Hall. Lori Dokken Lori can often be found playing happy hour in Crooner&#39;s main room and over the past three and a half decades, she has performed at every major venue in the Twin Cities from The Dakota To The Guthrie to The Ordway. A sought after accompanist, she is also a successful concert producer, educator, vocal coach, arranger, and vocalist.

href=\"https://soundcloud.com/wave-action-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wave Action</a><br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/wampiremusic\" rel=\"nofollow\">DJ Rocky Tinder</a> (of Wampire)<br>Join us in celebrating the release of the new Seance Crasher record, Basement Behavior.<br><br> 8:30pm | $7.00 day of show<br><br> After years of cutting this teeth in various Portland-area rock bands (Wampire among them) and a brief stint recording under his own name, scene veteran Kevin Rafn began recording under the alias Seance Crasher in 2013. Releasing a string of EPs over the past 3 years, Rafn, backed by his older brother Daniel, has meticulously honed his studio craft, often using analog recording techniques in the &quot;song-building&quot; tradition of classic-rock. And even though Seance Crasher&#39;s records are filled with precisely layered overdubs and airtight Rafn brother harmonies, underneath the studio polish lie truly singular pop-rock songs with honest-to-goodness hooks. <br><br>This newest record, and first full-length, from Seance Crasher delivers on the promise made by his previous four EPs. Co-produced by Portland&#39;s own Riley Geare, Basement Behavior is a rock album in the truest sense. Ten tracks, two pop singles and eight album cuts, make up the economic 35 minute run-time, showcasing Rafn&#39;s prowess at marrying slyly cynical slacker narratives with Rundgren-esque synth wizardry, punchy guitar riffs, and crisply multi-tracked vocals. And despite it being a busy couple years, Rafn is already back at work (and nearly half-way done) on the next Seance Crasher record. So although he may be looking ahead to the next project, those who have patiently waited to hear a LP&#39;s worth of Rafn&#39;s studio smarts and precision melodicism will soon enough be rewarded.<br><br>Basement Behavior is due out in August, 2016.<br><br>&quot;With a lyrical sense usually reserved for poets, Kevin Rafn really shows off his creative chops with this new release. Seance Crasher&#39;s music is strange and infectious, in the best way possible.&quot; - Scott McHale, Eleven PDX Magazine <br><br>&quot;The analog approach Rafn has used in Seance Crasher keeps his peculiar brand of studio pop feeling both ambitious and tidy in all the right places.&quot; - Pete Cottell, Willamette Week <br><br>&quot;Each tune is harmonized with progressive songcraft and an ironic vocal delivery, placing the tracks in that familiar warped-John-Hughes-soundtrack area of nostalgia.&quot; - Wyatt Schaffner, Portland Mercury <br>","modified":"2016-08-13 11:11:50","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"SEANCE CRASHER ALBUM RELEASE GALA","venue_address":"1001 SE Morrison","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2016-08-13 11:11:50","venue_id":"V0-001-001408209-1","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Holocene","venue_url":"http://portland.eventful.com/venues/holocene-/V0-001-001408209-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"MA","postal_code":"02122","going_count":null,"all_day":"2","latitude":"42.29898899002915","groups":null,"url":"http://boston.eventful.com/events/caravan-puppets-timeless-tales-/E0-001-095686736-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095686736-1","privacy":"1","city_name":"Boston","link_count":null,"longitude":"-71.06014426745912","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Massachusetts","start_time":"2016-08-31 00:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Fields Corner Branch of the Boston Public Library<br>1520 Dorchester Avenue<br>Dorchester, MA 02122 <br>Wednesday, August 31, 2016, 10:30 – 11:30am <br><br><img height=\"62\" src=\"http://www.trumba.com/i/DgDnLZPnlTdqKeL2eLlytcZ*.jpg\" width=\"100\"><br><br>Jonathan Keezing and the Caravan Puppets tell tales from around the world with original music.

Guided by his smooth vocals and lyric songwriting, an audience can expect a musical journey through the human condition – the question of disenchantment, the crossroads of doubt, a point of faith, a moment of whimsy, a tenuous hope.\n\nMarty Miles is much more than your basic singer, guitarist, and songwriter type. A consummate entertainer - a modern troubadour in the purest sense – he pulls you in.  The influence of artists such as Larry Norman, The Beatles, Dan Fogelberg, Ryan Adams, Mat Kearney, Elvis Costello, Bob Dylan, Lyle Lovett, John Mellencamp and others can often be heard in his own original tunes as he musically explores the landscape of this thing called Life.  A staple of the Michiana music scene, the South Bend Tribune once playfully referred to him as ‘ubiquitous’.\n\nExpect to hear music from his most recent CD, “Folk/Rock Adventures” (available on iTunes & CD Baby) and his previous albums, accented by his own folk/rock interpretations of favorites from other artists.\n\nOn a wider scale he has had the privilege of opening shows for the likes of John Michael Talbot, Barry McGuire, Honeytree, and Andrae Crouch.  His music has taken him all over the United States and as far away as Uganda, Africa. In March of 2008 he returned from a couple years of living and performing in Portugal.  Currently Northern Indiana is home base for his busy gig schedule.

The Boston band works in catchy, passionate three-minute rock songs recorded with too much punch to be lo-fi, too melodically contoured to be punk. So even with its blunt-force drum rolls and jagged chording, &quot;Dead Wrong&quot; sneaks up on you: on one end, it packs so many short, sharp hooks, the chorus can fly right by you on the first listen.

But the ONLY thing little about SIRSY is that there’s just two of them. The rest is bigger than balls on a buffalo.” SIRSY plays rock and soul that&#39;s chock full of sing along melodies, sincerity and heart, and just the right amount of sass. Lead Vocalist, Melanie, also plays a full drum kit - standing up (she’s featured in Modern Drummer and endorsed by Vater Percussion & Paiste Cymbals). She also plays bass on a keyboard with her drumstick and flute, too. Guitarist, Rich, plays a well loved and road worn Rickenbacker through a pedal board full of vintage effects. He also plays bass... on a keybaord with his feet. \n\nSIRSY plays 200+ shows per year all over the US. They&#39;ve shared stages with: Maroon 5, Train, Grace Potter, Lifehouse, RaRaRiot, Third Eye Blind, Collective Soul, Blues Traveler, Cheap Trick and many. They&#39;ve played SXSW, the Viper Room, Gramercy Theatre, Beachland Ballroom, World Café Live, & many more. SIRSY’s latest CD was produced by Grammy-winners, Paul Kolderie and Sean Slade (Radiohead, Hole, Dresden Dolls, Pixies). \n\n&quot;Little band, big sound.&quot; (-The Boston Globe, MA) \n&quot;One of most powerful and flexible voices you&#39;ll ever hear.
