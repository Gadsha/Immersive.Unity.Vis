Amsler. Exploring broken relationships, sordid characters, and unfortunate events, Tragic Jack delivers original Rock/Pop songs performed with conviction and groove. \n\n&quot;...a predominantly piano-driven sound that combines characteristics of Amsler’s indie rock and Hull’s blues, with straightforward song structures, bouncy piano and guitar progressions and Hull’s emphatic, Jagger-esque vocals.&quot; Daily Nebraskan \n\nThe project was born in the summer of 2013, when Hull and Amsler began writing together on Sunday afternoons at Silver Street Studio in Ashland, Nebraska. Amsler, fresh off a one-time reunion show with his former major label band The Millions, was interested in developing new material and getting back on the stage. Hull, owner of Silver Street Records, was keen to advance years of songwriting and production into a live band with a big sound. \n\n&quot;Their balanced pop-rock melodies ride through keys, guitar and cello. Hull’s vocals are rich and blues centered, with lyrics full of romance and conviction. &quot; - KZUM 89.3 \n\nOver the next three years and many Sunday afternoons, Hull and Amsler slowly crafted a diverse catalog of original songs flavored by the Rock, Soul, Gospel, Jazz, Indie, and Pop influences of the writing duo. \n\n“...their dynamic range really sets them apart. They’re not a one volume, one type of song/sound type of band.” Eli Mardock, Owner and Talent Buyer at The Royal Grove. \n\nIn the summer of 2016, Hull and Amsler rounded out the Tragic Jack live sound with the addition Lance Lehman on guitar and Brent Vignery on drums. The group recorded their debut album ‘Glasshouse Town’ in the spring of 2018 with plans for a fall release.\n\nDoors at 8:00pm \nFront Room\n$5 Advance/$7 Day of show\n\nAll ages show. \nCheck entry requirements at http://theslowdown.com/All-Ages\n\nMore info and music at http://www.tragicjack.com","modified":"2018-09-12 12:56:35","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Tragic Jack w/ Soul Ghost, Brad Hoshaw","venue_address":"729 North Fourteenth Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"charlesahull","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/041/168/059-9.jpeg_/tragic-jack-w-soul-ghost-brad-hoshaw-59.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/medium/I0-001/041/168/059-9.jpeg_/tragic-jack-w-soul-ghost-brad-hoshaw-59.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/041/168/059-9.jpeg_/tragic-jack-w-soul-ghost-brad-hoshaw-59.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/thumb/I0-001/041/168/059-9.jpeg_/tragic-jack-w-soul-ghost-brad-hoshaw-59.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2018-09-12 12:56:35","venue_id":"V0-001-000553490-9","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2018-09-28 23:30:00","venue_name":"The Slowdown","venue_url":"http://omaha.eventful.com/venues/the-slowdown-/V0-001-000553490-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NY","postal_code":"10010","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"40.741073","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/kiss-keep-sexy-and-simple-/E0-001-116091022-9@2018092822?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-116091022-9@2018092822","privacy":"1","city_name":"New York","link_count":null,"longitude":"-73.99293","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New York","start_time":"2018-09-28 22:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" So Fly Entertainment and Tailor Made Group Presents K.I.S.S Fridays (Keep it Sexy and Simple)  Taj II  48 W 21st St NY, NY 10010 Everyone free before 12am, Reduced admission after (Must RSVP and use Guestlist at the door) 2 for 1 drinks 11-12 Dress code is Sexy and Chic (No hoodies, flashy sneakers, baggy clothing.

For nine days from August 24 to September 2, 1921, in Logan County, West Virginia, some 15,000 armed coal miners confronted 2,000 lawmen and strikebreakers, called the Logan Defenders. The &quot;Defenders&quot; were backed by coal mine operators during an attempt by the miners to unionize the southwestern West Virginia coalfields. The battle ended after approximately one million rounds were fired, and the United States Army intervened by presidential order. This fictionalized account of a little known historical event will put you in the heart of the war.
