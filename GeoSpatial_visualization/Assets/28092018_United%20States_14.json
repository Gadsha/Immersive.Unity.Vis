Musicians from all over the world will gather to play tunes, share stories, camp and commune with one another. The laid back attitude of the festival allows musicians of all types and skill levels to take time away from the business of life and just enjoy the sweetness of playing a guitar or singing a song. Ouibache will offer limited primitive and RV camping spaces. Local food and beverage vendors will make available their offerings throughout the grounds. Stage shows will feature local and national acts of all kinds. Music, demonstrations, dancing and all sorts of fun will be going on all day and night. Jam tents will be set up on the grounds so make sure to bring your instruments! This is a chance for you to come and embrace all kinds of music in a beautiful outdoor setting. There is something for everyone.

Formed in 2007, Deni has described his sound as being &quot;soulful music from outer space&quot; using analog, electronic and acoustic elements to craft dense layers and unique sound textures. As Geographer, Deni has release three full-length albums, Innocent Ghosts in 2008, Myth in 2012, and Ghost Modern in 2015; along with two (EPs), Animal Shapes in 2010, Endless Motion in 2015. His newest EP, Alone Time, featuring the songs Read My Mind, and So Low, is due out in March 2018.Deni relocated to San Francisco from New Jersey, after living with the aftermath of his sister&#39;s tragic death a few years earlier. While staying on the floor of his friends&#39; apartment in the Haight, Deni found a synthesizer on the street, and began to channel both his grief and his optimism into the songs that would become Innocent Ghosts. This theme would continue through all his music, which pits intense and emotionally probing lyrics with momentous and soaring arrangements, often featuring electric cello.The Animal Shapes EP put Geographer on the map, and launched his career. Since then Geographer has headlined many national tours, played Outside Lands, Firefly, and other festivals, released 2 critically acclaimed albums, and performed with such musical luminaries as K.Flay, The Flaming Lips, Young the Giant, Tycho, Ratatat, Betty Who, and Tokyo Police Club.
