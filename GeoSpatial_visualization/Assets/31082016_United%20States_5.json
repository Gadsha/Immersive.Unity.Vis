The growl of a good truck engine, the fiercest passion for his country home and family and an uncanny ability to breathe new life into old forms of music give them a pedigree many Americana acts would kill for and an ironclad work ethic keeps them on the road 250 dates a year, playing for the people with hurricane force. Locked in with an audience, the band create their own community and welcome the crowd into it, transporting them away from their troubles to joyous release, the way great musicians have done for centuries. The Rev. J. Peyton, his wife Breezy and Ben &quot;Bird Dog&quot; Bussell are a living breathing embodiment of the traditions and hard work ethic native to their Brown County, Indiana home. Their new album Between The Ditches is a chronicle of this lifestyle.With a reputation for their incendiary live shows well established, The Big Damn Band set out to make the album that would finally capture the same heat. Recorded at White Arc Studio in Bloomington, Indiana, the album was produced by The Rev. Peyton and Paul Mahern (John Mellencamp, Iggy Pop), and mastered by Brian Lucey (Black Keys, Dr. John, Shins). For previous albums, the band had recorded live, straight through in the same mode as a live show. Between the Ditches came together more slowly, with care. &quot;We approached it saying we were going to make a record this time, not just a recording,&quot; explained the Rev. He used a different guitar set up on almost every track, employing two &#39;30s National guitars, a cigar box guitar, a custom shop Gibson flattop 1929 L2 and an Airline map electric guitar. The primary amps are custom Weber amps made by Weber speakers both are one of a kind.Their fifth album, Between The Ditchesfeatures a new level of craftmanship in both recording technique and songwriting. The Rev. feels that it&#39;s their best album to date.&quot;I&#39;m very proud of this album, the songwriting and the playing.&quot; The guitar playing alone should put the Rev. in the same class with his much revered idols. The songwriting boasts an added maturity and runs the gamut in subject matter from the barn burning, tongue in cheek, &quot;Shut the Screen&quot;, (where &quot;It&#39;s too dang hot and the bugs are too dang mean&quot;) to the evils of strip mining, an issue close to the hearts of this Indiana born and bred band in, &quot;Don&#39;t Grind It Down&quot;. There seems to be a theme expressed throughout the album and stated clearly in their first single,&quot;Devils Look Like Angels&quot;: &quot;Devil don&#39;t live down in hell, the devil&#39;s right here doing very well&quot;.&quot; Burn up some backroads, drive up to the storeThey just don&#39;t make &#39;em like this anymore&quot;Rev Peyton&#39;s first introduction to music was his father&#39;s record collection of blues-oriented rock. At age 12 his father gave him a Kay brand guitar, eventually purchasing a Gorilla amplifier once he learned to play. And play he did. He became infatuated with pre-World War II country blues, and a desire to learn the fingerstyle picking of artists like Charlie Patton. Fingerstyle refers to using each of the right hand fingers independently in order to play the multiple parts of a musical arrangement that would normally be played by several band members. Bass, harmonic accompaniment, melody, and percussion can all be played simultaneously when playing fingerstyle.Keith Richards has said that the first time he heard Robert Johnson&#39;s recordings he asked &quot;Who&#39;s the other guy playing with him?&quot; Of course there wasn&#39;t one. When you listen to the songs on Between The Ditches you will be hard pressed to believe it is only one guitarist.&quot;Nothing&#39;s really freeIt all comes with a fee&quot;Misfortune struck the Rev. early on in the form of a dehabilitating condition that caused excruciating pain in his hands. Doctors told Peyton he&#39;d never be able to hold his left hand in fretting position again. But he persevered and when the bandages were removed, Peyton discovered a new flexibility and greater control in his fretting hand that enabled him to play in the fingerstyle that he longed to play.&quot;If it&#39;s me with youThen we&#39;ll get through&quot;It was during his convalescence that he met his wife to be, Breezy. &quot;I was crazy in love with her right from the start&quot;. He credits Breezy with installing a confidence in his playing and his life in general that he had previously lacked. Breezy Peyton&#39;s explosive washboard playing, sweet back-up vocals and striking good looks didn&#39;t hurt their live show either.Completing the trio is cousin Aaron Persinger on drums. &quot;He&#39;s a human metronome&quot;, says the Rev. Persinger&#39;s drum kit gives new meaning to the term &#39;stripped down&#39; and features a plastic 5 gallon bucket, for which he has a sponsorship deal for replacements. With their line-up finalized the band sold everything they owned in a garage sale and headed out on the open road.&quot;I&#39;ve been broke down (BROKE DOWN) from sea to shining seaYou&#39;ve been everywhere, I&#39;ve been broke down thereAnd three times in Tennessee&quot;In 2009, they toured opening for Clutch, an extensive headlining tour of Europe and began their relationship with the Van&#39;s Warped Tour, playing 12 dates in 2009 on the Kevin Says stage. They were on the entire 2010 Van&#39;s Warped Tour on the Alternative Press stage and they received the Best Band of Warped Tour award, voted by the crew, bands, and promoters. They&#39;ve also toured with Flogging Molly, Rev. Horton Heat, Derek Trucks and Mofro just to name a few.&quot;Keep it between the ditches&quot;This band is fun sure, a lot of fun, but they are for real. From virtuoso musicianship to great songwriting, Between The Ditches has got it all. All from a little Brown County, Indiana band that&#39;s got the nerve (and the right) to call themselves, Rev. Peyton&#39;s Big Damn Band!","modified":"2016-08-18 02:46:19","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"chris_radcliff","linker":"evdb","name":"The Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/The-Reverend-Peyton-s-Big-Damn-Band?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000025075-6","short_bio":"country-blues aficionados from rural Indiana"}},"title":"The Reverend Peyton's Big Damn Band","venue_address":"1915 E 7th Avenue","geocode_type":"Zip Code Based GeoCodes","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/497/399-8.gif_/the-reverend-peytons-big-damn-band-99.gif","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/000/497/399-8.gif_/the-reverend-peytons-big-damn-band-99.gif","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/497/399-8.gif_/the-reverend-peytons-big-damn-band-99.gif","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/000/497/399-8.gif_/the-reverend-peytons-big-damn-band-99.gif","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-07-28 12:16:15","venue_id":"V0-001-008692726-9","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Orpheum","venue_url":"http://tampa.eventful.com/venues/the-orpheum-/V0-001-008692726-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Chicago","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"TX","postal_code":"78745","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"30.2005","groups":null,"url":"http://austin.eventful.com/events/bret-coats-/E0-001-095353171-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095353171-1","privacy":"1","city_name":"Austin","link_count":null,"longitude":"-97.797","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Texas","start_time":"2016-08-31 22:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":"     <br>All Ages","modified":"2016-07-30 19:07:08","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Bret Coats","venue_address":"5326 Manchaca Rd","geocode_type":"Zip Code Based GeoCodes","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/030/999/449-2.jpeg_/bret-coats-49.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/030/999/449-2.jpeg_/bret-coats-49.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/030/999/449-2.jpeg_/bret-coats-49.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/030/999/449-2.jpeg_/bret-coats-49.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-07-30 19:07:08","venue_id":"V0-001-008612905-2","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Strange Brew, Austin Coffee","venue_url":"http://austin.eventful.com/venues/strange-brew-austin-coffee-/V0-001-008612905-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Chicago","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"TN","postal_code":"37201","going_count":null,"all_day":"2","latitude":"36.1547290","groups":null,"url":"http://nashville.eventful.com/events/briana-tyson-and-friends-/E0-001-095529814-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095529814-8","privacy":"1","city_name":"Nashville","link_count":null,"longitude":"-86.7823480","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Tennessee","start_time":"2016-08-31 00:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <p>In the midst of Music Row, its live music venues, or in a quiet room with some of Nashville’s biggest writers, you will find Briana Tyson.

Masters in cultivating  fuzzy, distorted massive sounding heaviness contrasted with ethereal high range melodic vocals, MARS RED SKY have become much of an intriguing curiosity over the recent years  as Classic Rock (UK) illustrated as “Between doom rock and sky - scraping 70s psyche pop,  with utter abandon (….) A record that will put hair on your feet !” . <br><br> Worldwide press has been roaring usually pointing out  the band’s “Charisma and consistency in quality song writing and execution” as in THE SLEEPING SHAMAN webzine described. Also as THE OBELISK passionately wrote “One of the best and most distinct acts in or out of heavy psychedelia ” or as ABOUT.COM confirmed : “A fantastic voyage!”. <br><br> MARS RED SKY’s brand new album ‘Apex III – Praise for the Burning Soul’ pushes boundaries further into a colossal heavy sound - Produced by Gabriel Zander (from Brasil who also engineered ‘Stranded in Arcadia’) and Jacob Dennis in Studio Cryogene in Bègles in France -   The band has forged grandiose and hypnotizing thickly produced songs rooted through a wider range of musical influences stretching from Robert Wyatt, The Beatles, Nick Drake, Neil young to bands like Electric Wizard, Acid King and obviously Black Sabbath.  <br><br><br>Lotus Thief<br>-from San Francisco, CA<br>-“As the unrelenting grip of stupidity tightens around America’s most hallowed institutions - churches, schools, legislatures and the like - it’s hard not to notice that metal and its affinities just fucking keep getting smarter. Consider Lotus Thief’s Rervm - a beautifully crafted adaptation of Titus Lucretius Carus’ epic philisophical poem (and groundbreaking work of natural philosophy).”<br> - Rod Smith, Decibel Magazine<br><br> “The music drives with power, but it’s driving the space lanes rather than any earthbound highway — a course that become unmistakably clear with three minutes left, when the pistons stop and the song glides like a satellite in orbit, a cosmic dream unfolding.”<br> - No Clean Singing<br><br> &quot;This is a fantastic album in the true spirit of the San Francisco music scene – left of centre, forward thinking and inspired – well worth forking out your money to hear this in its glory.

and raised in Sandpoint Idaho, Shook Twins are an Indie folk-pop band hailing from Portland, Oregon. Identical twins, Katelyn and Laurie Shook, and Niko Daoussis form the band’s core. Central to Shook Twins’ sound is their wide range of instrumentation: banjo, acoustic and electric guitars, electric bass, mandolin, electronic drums, face drum (beatbox), glockenspiel, ukulele, banjo-head drumming and their signature Golden Egg. Beautiful twin harmonies, layered upon acoustic and electric instrumentation, coupled with Laurie’s inventive use of percussive and ambient vocal loops, and Katelyn’s repurposed telephone microphone, set their sound apart, creating a unique and eccentric blend of folk, roots, groove and soul.<p>Their eclectic style fluctuates from song to song; drawing from their life experience they write about being potters’ daughters, the sway of the subconscious, imagined superpowers and a chicken friend named ‘Rose.’ Shook Twins also pull out unexpected covers on classic hits as well as their friends’ songs, and get-down to rhythm driven dance numbers with their 90’s hits female supergroup, Sideboob (w/ Mimi Naja of Fruition, Allie Kral of Yonder Mountain Stringband and Kat Fountain). Katelyn and Laurie are the main songwriters, but they also back up their band member Niko Daoussis (Niko Slice), adding his uniquely compelling songs to the mix.<p>After releasing their first album You Can Have the Rest, the twin sisters moved to Portland where they released Window (featuring Bonnie Paine and Bridget Law of Elephant Revival). Both albums were recorded and produced in Santa Cruz, California, at InDigital Studios with Brody Bergholz and Mason Rothchild.  Shook Twins recorded their third album, What We Do, with Grammy nominated producer Ryan Hadlock at Bear Creek Studios. They are currently recording new music at Hallowed Halls in Portland, OR with Justin Phelps.<p>Shook Twins have shared the stage with artists including: Ryan Adams,Gregory Alan Isakov, Greensky Bluegrass, Mason Jennings, Blitzen Trapper, Railroad Earth, Keller Williams, David Grisman, Carolina Chocolate Drops, Sarah Jarosz, Laura Veirs, The Fruit Bats, Jonatha Brooke, JJ Grey and MoFro, The Indigo Girls, Crooked Still, Jason Webley, The BoDeans, Elephant Revival and more.<p>Spanning the spectrum from distinctive and genuine to amusing and whimsical, Shook Twins’ laid-back and fun stage presence draws the listener in, allowing them to take the audience on an adventure. 2016 is gearing up to be an exciting year for them; besides opening up for Greensky Bluegrass on a 13 show tour, they are also supporting Keller Williams for several shows in Northern California, and playing Red Rocks Amphitheater with Gregory Alan Isakov and Ani Difranco. They are looking forward to a Spring tour in Europe where they’ll be playing two festivals in Germany and six shows in the UK.  Festivals for this year include WinterWonderGrass Tahoe (CA), Huckleberry Jam (ID), Safety Harbor Fest (FL), Apple Jam Music Festival (OR), Beaverstock (CA), Summer Camp Music Festival (IL), Revival Fest (MN), Northwest String Summit (OR), Fayetteville Roots Festival (AR), Summer Meltdown (WA), Oregon Country Fair (OR) and more! Keep an ear out for their new single “Call Me Out,” recorded at Indigital Studios.</p></p></p></p></p>","modified":"2016-06-03

Guided by his smooth vocals and lyric songwriting, an audience can expect a musical journey through the human condition – the question of disenchantment, the crossroads of doubt, a point of faith, a moment of whimsy, a tenuous hope.\n\nMarty Miles is much more than your basic singer, guitarist, and songwriter type. A consummate entertainer - a modern troubadour in the purest sense – he pulls you in.  The influence of artists such as Larry Norman, The Beatles, Dan Fogelberg, Ryan Adams, Mat Kearney, Elvis Costello, Bob Dylan, Lyle Lovett, John Mellencamp and others can often be heard in his own original tunes as he musically explores the landscape of this thing called Life.  A staple of the Michiana music scene, the South Bend Tribune once playfully referred to him as ‘ubiquitous’.\n\nExpect to hear music from his most recent CD, “Folk/Rock Adventures” (available on iTunes & CD Baby) and his previous albums, accented by his own folk/rock interpretations of favorites from other artists.\n\nOn a wider scale he has had the privilege of opening shows for the likes of John Michael Talbot, Barry McGuire, Honeytree, and Andrae Crouch.  His music has taken him all over the United States and as far away as Uganda, Africa. In March of 2008 he returned from a couple years of living and performing in Portugal.  Currently Northern Indiana is home base for his busy gig schedule.

This group of multi-instrumentalists renders tales of the beauty parlor and the junkyard alike with the stylings of rag-and-bones folk, roots-rock, and psychedelia. Accessible yet indefinable, this sonic collage stitched by this wayfaring bevy is perhaps best described as nothing more than a reflection of the bands multifarious members. Ryan Andersons melodic rambling combines the shipwrecked lyricism of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and the wit and wisdom of Tom Waits. The group is rounded out by Steve Leaf on guitar, Dan Ingenthorn on bass, Mark Zoller on drums, and Isaac Lyons on keys.

people live in Nashville and I thought maybe I could rub up against a few of &#39;em if I move there...&quot;Just as he&#39;d hoped, Lewis arrived in Nashville and made a fan in producer/musician/entrepreneur Matt Urmy following an open mic at The 5 Spot. Urmy helped corral such all-stars as famed guitarist Kenny Vaughan (Marty Stuart & His Fabulous Superlatives, Lana Del Rey, Ray Lamontagne) to back the young singer/songwriter&#39;s first real session, &quot;a bunch of insanely talented musicians that I&#39;d never played with, that had never heard my music. I was a nervous wreck.&quot;Despite his understandable jitters, Lewis and his sidemen clicked from the jump, tracking six songs in just one day. He saved enough to record six more songs and in January 2011, a second session followed. Released in 2012, Sam Lewis received national acclaim, applauded by No Depression for &quot;calling on the musical spirit of Leon Russell and maybe Al Green, after a weekend with Willie and Waylon in Dripping Springs, TX.&quot;With his compelling songs, stirring melodies, and preternaturally soulful voice, Sam Lewis has quickly established himself as one of Nashville&#39;s most talented new tunesmiths. Waiting On You his sophomore album via Brash Music and follow-up to 2012&#39;s self-titled debut reverberates with earnest emotion and restless energy, rich with the intimate lyricism of folk, country&#39;s raw integrity, and a lived-in muscularity born of Lewis&#39; captivating vocal timbre. Songs like &quot;3/4 Time&quot; and the tender title track are intuitive and organic, the rollicking &quot;Things Will Never Be The Same&quot; groove-powered and irresistible. Produced by The Wood Brothers&#39; Oliver Wood (Tedeschi Trucks Band, Shemekia Copeland) and featuring a stellar supporting cast of Music City&#39;s finest session musicians, Waiting On You reveals Sam Lewis to be an exceptionally gifted troubadour, forthright, genuine and completely his own.Lewis sees himself as a link in a lineage, a continuum of truth-tellers and troubadours like Hank Williams, Fred Eaglesmith, and John Prine, singer/songwriters who utilized diverse elements of American music to create their own unique canons. Brimming with candid confidence and a determined artlessness, Waiting On You is a sure landmark on what has already been an extraordinary journey as well as a resonant signpost towards future triumphs.He has cultivated his career and craft, performing in front of increasingly larger audiences while also wowing crowds with mostly solo acoustic shows from New York to Los Angeles and multiple tours of the United Kingdom to date. &quot;I&#39;m just making friends, man,&quot; Lewis says. &quot;I&#39;ve been really really lucky so far.

From the propulsive, high octane opening track “I’ve Been Around” to the brooding closer “Pricks & Thorns” the album never falters, charting fresh new territory with ebullient authority. Their hard hitting aggression, anchored by a throbbing gutbucket bottom end and topped off with bandleader Elvis Suissa’s passionate vocals, unfailingly pulls the listener in. High impact, soul deep, thoroughly original, this is uncut rock & roll expression that goes upside the head with stunning force.<p>Such a dynamic achievement is the result of a hard earned perspective. One of Los Angeles’ hardest working bands–and biggest club draws–Three Bad Jacks have been pounding it out, non-stop, since the late 20th century. Typically averaging over 250 shows a year, selling out rooms from Hollywood to New York City and headlining on numerous European festivals, the groups’ dedication and rebel spirit have long since been honed to perfection. It rings true in every note that singer-guitarist Suissa, bassist Dave Eckles and drummer John Palmer strike, each of whom display a mastery and understanding of the underground American big beat heritage. Variously labeled in the media as both rockabilly and psychobilly, with Pictures & Memories From Home the band has delivered a genuine rock & roll statement, one that not only expands on previous releases Made of Stone and Crazy in the Head but also rates as an important step forward in the artistic exploration of an increasingly bastardized art form.<p>“I’m really excited about this record.” Suissa said. “It’s a straight-up rock & roll record that draws from that transitional period of the late ’50s-early 60s, but it’s also as modern and original sounding as we could make it.” The album echoes with trace influences from garage primitivism to stomping Deep Southern rockabilly, yet all of it is filtered through the bands own unique prism, resulting in a sound that “original” scarcely begins to cover. Produced by Suissa, mixed by studio veteran Dave Schiffman (Nine Inch Nails, System of a Down), mastered by Howie Weinberg (Clash, Iggy, Ramones) and featuring key contributions, on keyboards and strings, from Rami Jaffe (Wallflowers, Foo Fighters), the disc has a gloriously full, unruly tone, yet shifts to tender balladry with effortless, fully realized ease (striking examples here are the bluesy “Beautiful” and the heartfelt family-themed “Noah & Jacob’s Song”).<p>While use of the word “mature” may seem the contradictory to Three Bad Jacks international reputation as rock & roll wild-men, their mix of the sensitive and savage is impressive, and the ability to navigate such a broad musical spectrum is even more so.<br> Again, it’s all about experience, and with records sales topping 150,000 to date, numerous songs placed on television and video game soundtracks and having long since graduated from selling out hometown venues like the Troubadour, House of Blues, Galaxy Theater, Fonda-Music Box and Key Club to sharing bills and touring with the likes of Joe Strummer, Jerry Lee Lewis, Dwight Yoakam, Social Distortion and Bouncing Souls, Three Bad Jacks are nothing less than a force of nature. All of that wild bandstand action–and after-hours philosophy–brings them an almost supernatural insight that has critically enhanced the band’s indisputable natural talent. Just one listen to Pictures & Memories From Home will drive that fact home–loud and clear.</p></p></p></p>","modified":"2016-07-29 23:13:18","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"msdolly_lolly","linker":"evdb","name":"Three Bad Jacks","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Three-Bad-Jacks?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000050108-5","short_bio":"Alternative / Heavy Metal / Rock"}},"title":"Three Bad Jacks -with Lash LaRue & The Hired Guns & The Pink Flamingos","venue_address":"6212 Maple Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/001/138/023-9.bmp_/three-bad-jacks-23.bmp","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/001/138/023-9.bmp_/three-bad-jacks-23.bmp","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/001/138/023-9.bmp_/three-bad-jacks-23.bmp","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/001/138/023-9.bmp_/three-bad-jacks-23.bmp","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-07-29 23:13:18","venue_id":"V0-001-001157665-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Waiting Room","venue_url":"http://omaha.eventful.com/venues/the-waiting-room-/V0-001-001157665-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Los_Angeles","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"OR","postal_code":"97520","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"42.1986410","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/ashland_or/events/blake-morgan-janita-live-public-house-/E0-001-095437601-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095437601-4","privacy":"1","city_name":"Ashland","link_count":null,"longitude":"-122.7103470","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Oregon","start_time":"2016-08-31 20:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":"New York City-based alt-rock artists Blake Morgan and Janita, are embarking on their co-headlining nine-city West Coast tour, from August 22 through September 3, 2016.

Lead Vocalist, Melanie, also plays a full drum kit - standing up (she’s featured in Modern Drummer and endorsed by Vater Percussion & Paiste Cymbals). She also plays bass on a keyboard with her drumstick and flute, too. Guitarist, Rich, plays a well loved and road worn Rickenbacker through a pedal board full of vintage effects. He also plays bass... on a keybaord with his feet. \n\nSIRSY plays 200+ shows per year all over the US. They&#39;ve shared stages with: Maroon 5, Train, Grace Potter, Lifehouse, RaRaRiot, Third Eye Blind, Collective Soul, Blues Traveler, Cheap Trick and many.

A decade is a long time for any band to persevere, let alone a band that mines the relatively unmarketable niche of protracted instrumental dirges. But whereas many bands on the louder end of the rock-based instrumental world are content to work within the confines of the crescendos and washed-out timbres laid out by their predecessors, Russian Circles persistently expand their creative boundaries by working with a wider swath of sounds and structures. In many ways, their last album Memorial was a fitting cap to that first decade; it was an elegy to the past, a token of remembrance to the aural explorations of the bands formative years. It encompassed the many facets of the bands catalog: harrowing gloom, cinematic majesty, primitive bludgeonings, bittersweet dexterity, and morose minimalism.With their sixth album Guidance, Russian Circles carry on in their quest to conjure multi-dimensional dramatic instrumental narratives and to scout out new textures from their respective instruments. Songs arent constructed out of highbrow concepts; theyre forged out of gut instinct and base emotional response. Nor was the bandas is often the case with artists later in their careerinterested in testing their fans patience or securing a new broader audience with a radical reinvention. Instead, Russian Circles use Guidance to continue examining the polarity of quiet and loud, complexity and simplicity, ugliness and beauty. Every Russian Circles album has had its share of new sonic vistas, and Guidance finds the band still searching out new sounds while continuing to play to the collective strengths of guitarist Mike Sullivan, drummer Dave Turncrantz, and bassist Brian Cook. Starting with the meditative restraint of album opener Asa, Guidance sets off on a path of metallic savagery (Vorel, Calla), arpeggio tectonics (Mota), mercurial anthems (Afrika), somber segues (Overboard), and seismic Americana noir (Lisboa). With the help of engineer/co-producer Kurt Ballou and his God City Studio, Russian Circles were able to capture this broad tonal palette and wide array of emotional motifs into a cohesive journey through the tumultuous corners of human existence.We often expect artists to fall into patterns and formulas, but for Russian Circles the creative method is still a mystery. Songs develop at their own pace. Inspiration comes from strange sources. If anything, the process of writing is every bit the enigma it was back when the band crafted their first song in 2004. Life itself is a struggle with the unknown and a search for meaning, and the creative process for Russian Circles has mirrored that pursuit. The radical dynamic shifts and straightforward production of Enter, the lockstep metallic attack and pensive comedowns of Station, the symphonic grandeur of Geneva, the grit and grime of Empros, and the oscillation between melancholy and wrath on Memorial were all incremental steps towards an ideal, and Guidance brings the band that much closer to that realization. In the interim between albums, a veteran handed off an envelope of war photos to the spouse of a band member. The photos depicted a man being led to his execution. There was no context for the traumatic scenes, no history, no background. Yet the dignity this anonymous figure exuded in his fatalistic march resonated with the band. Here was someone that knew his fate and marched boldly towards his destiny. The band used these photos for the Guidance album art, knowing that we all march towards our own conclusions, and we can only hope that we face our futures with the same honor and nobility. If the bands fourth album Empros (Greek translation: Onward) was a statement of perseverance, Guidance became a statement of striding into the future undeterred by what lies ahead.Guidance comes out August 5th on Sargent House. The album is available on vinyl and CD, as well in all standard digital formats.","modified":"2016-08-10 22:43:16","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"bobfather","linker":"evdb","name":"Russian Circles","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Russian-Circles?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000008675-3","short_bio":"Indie / Experimental / Progressive"}},"title":"Russian Circles","venue_address":"128 NE Russel Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/195/092-3.gif_/russian-circles-92.gif","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/000/195/092-3.gif_/russian-circles-92.gif","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/195/092-3.gif_/russian-circles-92.gif","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/000/195/092-3.gif_/russian-circles-92.gif","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-08-10 22:43:16","venue_id":"V0-001-000104468-4","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Wonder Ballroom","venue_url":"http://portland.eventful.com/venues/wonder-ballroom-/V0-001-000104468-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Chicago","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"MO","postal_code":null,"going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"38.6277200","groups":null,"url":"http://stlouis.eventful.com/events/ginger-doss-/E0-001-095265688-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095265688-2","privacy":"1","city_name":"Saint Louis","link_count":null,"longitude":"-90.2507537","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Missouri","start_time":"2016-08-31 19:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" VENUS FEST AFTER PARTY Hate that venus fest over?

Embracing an inclusive approach to music-making, the SOB seeks to democratize both \u2028the production and reception of concert music. Founded in 2007 by artistic director Eli Spindel, the String Orchestra of Brooklyn is “quickly solidifying its role as a major orchestral figure in the borough” (I Care if You Listen), providing an enriching creative outlet to hundreds of musicians, and accessible, adventurous programming to thousands of concertgoers and community members.\nPraised for its passionate commitment to the music of our time by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, I Care if You Listen, Cool Hunting, and more, the SOB places a special emphasis on the work of living composers. 2015 highlights have included a 6-hour performance/installation for the new Whitney Museum in collaboration with Tony Conrad and John Cale, and being featured on Richard Carrick’s newly released album Cycles of Evolution. The orchestra has presented world premieres by such composers as Anthony Coleman, Judd Greenstein, Katherine Young, Alex Mincek, Catherine Lamb, Scott Wollschleger, Christopher Cerrone, and many more. Upcoming commissions include the work of Baltimore composer Alexandra Gardner for the SOB’s annual String Theories Festival in spring of 2016.\nThe orchestra, which seeks to increase its impact in the community through artistic \u2028and institutional collaborations, has collaborated with numerous vital Brooklyn-based organizations, including Roulette, ISSUE Project Room, American Opera Projects, GHOSTLIGHT Chorus, loadbang, the Fort Greene Park Conservancy, and the Noel Pointer Foundation. Guest soloists and conductors have included such stars as Tito Muñoz, Charlers Neidich, Steve Beck, Matt Boehler, David Kaplan, Spencer Myer, and the Toomai String Quintet.\n***\nWilliam Brittelle is a Brooklyn-based composer of post-genre electro-acoustic music. His primary musical mentors include Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Del Tredici, Mike Longo, longtime pianist/arranger for Dizzy Gillespie, and punk guitarist Richard Lloyd of Television.  Brittelle’s work is characterized by the melding of complex thematic ideas, rhythms, and formal structure with the visceral power and surface appeal of pop/rock music, a duality perhaps best represented by his most recent album Loving the Chambered Nautilus. Written specifically for the players of ACME (the American Contemporary Music Ensemble), Nautilus is a series of electro-acoustic chamber music pieces melding classic synthesizer sounds and drum programming with virtuosic and textured classical composition. The album has been hailed as a hallmark of the next wave of classical composition. Following an All Things Considered feature, Nautilus hit #1 on Amazon’s Chamber Music Chart. The New York Times labeled the work “bright and joyous”, and MUSO dubbed it “a fast, fun, freedom-fuelled flurry of a record”. Perhaps most powerfully, Classical TV stated: “William Brittelle is creating a body of work that has no precedent, and marks him as a one of the most promising heirs of the vital American maverick tradition.”\nPrevious to Nautilus, Brittelle released Television Landscape, his fully-composed, post-apocalyptic art rock concept album scored for orchestra, rock band, synths, and children’s choir.  Dubbed “irresistible” by The New York Times and “a glorious reclamation of lush sounds crusty critics have vilified for years” by Time Out NY, Television Landscape drew substantial praise from both rock and classical critics, leading the Los Angeles Times to muse, “You might wonder if Jane’s Addiction had discovered the soul of Debussy.” eMusic called the album “expansive, anthemic, all-encompassing, shot through with raw emotion” and named it to its ”Albums of the Year” list. The album’s centerpiece, the nostalgia-soaked soft rock ballad Sheena Easton, was singled out by Popmatters for its “complex orchestrations” and “mind-bending arrangements” and taste-maker rock blog My Old Kentucky called the track “one of the more interesting tunes I’ve heard in a while.” The Believer magazine chose the album’s closing track The Color of Rain for inclusion in its prestigious annual music issue.\nBrittelle’s music has been the subject of features in The New York Times (Sunday Arts & Leisure), the Los Angeles Times, Time Out NY, and NPR’s All Things Considered.  His compositions have been presented across the U.S. and internationally., including the Festival Internacional in Chihuahua, Mexico, the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires by JACK Quartet, Pittsburgh’s Music on the Edge series, Seattle’s Town Hall, and the Ecstatic Music Festival at Merkin Hall. His music has been commissioned by the Seattle Symphony, the Indianapolis Symphony, the Baltimore Symphony, the Walker Art Center, the Alabama Symphony and the Eastern Connecticut Symphony. Recent commissions include Spiritual America, a series of electro-acoustic orchestral art songs featuring the band Wye Oak, Love Letter for Arca for the Seattle Symphony, and Psychedelics for the Grammy-winning vocal group Roomful of Teeth and the Williams College Chorus. Past collaborative works include orchestral arrangements for the electronic artists Oneohtrix Point Never and Son Lux. Recent and upcoming performances include dates with the Baltimore Symphony, the Basel Sinfonietta, and the Liquid Music Series/Walker Art Center.\nBrittelle has been the recipient of grants and awards from the National Endowment of the Arts, American Music Center, American Composers Forum, the Jerome Foundation, the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, NYSCA, and ASCAP.  Along with composers Judd Greenstein and Sarah Kirkland Snider, he co-artistic directs New Amsterdam, a vital Brooklyn-based record label and presenting organization.  He is a passionate promoter, presenter, and producer of new and adventurous music in New York City, having overseen the release of more than 70 critically acclaimed recordings.
