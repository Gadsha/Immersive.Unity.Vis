Body fat measurements at the start and end of the program. Professional and group support for your success Virtual Gastric Band is a non-surgical and safe technique, which uses the power of hypnosis to retrain the mind to be satisfied with smaller portions.  It’s like ‘flicking a switch in the brain’.  It changes your attitude towards food and helps you take charge of your eating habits. This innovative technique was developed and lab tested in England (where Hypnosis is as mainstream as a doctor’s visit) with a 95% success rate. Having a foreign body inside your stomach (virtual or real) won’t deal with the emotional relationship with food.  Incorporating the Am I Hungry?® Mindful Eating Program adds an additional layer of understanding that allows you to take the emotion out of food so you can be in charge of your nutrition.  And Hypnosis back up solidifies the change in coping strategies for good.
