In his youth, Cordero experimented with a variety of rock genres from alternative, gothic, skate, and shoegazer to punk rock. A chance performance by the famous flamenco guitarist, Paco de Lucia, ignited Randy’s deep passion for flamenco guitar. Today, Cordero may be seen performing traditional Spanish flamenco guitar with flamenco dance companies all over Texas or in collaboration with Latin-Jazz guitarists creating a unique blend of flamenco-latin jazz music. For the last 20 years, Cordero has refined his talents, studying Spanish flamenco guitar all over the US and Spain with prestigious guitarists including Jose Luis Rodriguez, Rene Heredia, Chuscales, Domingo Rubichi, Roberto Castellon, Paco Garrigues, and Kai Narezo. Cordero’s style is a blend of traditional Jerez-style flamenco and contemporary influences. He has worked closely with The Flamenco Poets Society of Houston where his work has received recognition from many organizations, including Poets and Writers, Inc., and author of The Flamenco Academy. Sarah Bird.

The three have been making music ever since, although it wasn&#39;t until 20 years later in 2005, when Coach Cotton was raising young&#39;uns of his own, that the inspiration for Rocknoceros finally crystallized.Rocknoceros has since dominated the Washington, DC children&#39;s music scene and gained significant national recognition with performances at Lollapalooza, Austin City Limits, Wolf Trap, and The Kennedy Center.","modified":"2018-04-27 23:35:03","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Rocknoceros","venue_address":"227 Maple Ave E","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":"on various days","calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/017/123/648-9.jpeg_/rocknoceros-48.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/medium/I0-001/017/123/648-9.jpeg_/rocknoceros-48.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/017/123/648-9.jpeg_/rocknoceros-48.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/thumb/I0-001/017/123/648-9.jpeg_/rocknoceros-48.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2014-09-02 09:19:40","venue_id":"V0-001-011763146-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Jammin' Java","venue_url":"http://washingtondc.eventful.com/venues/jammin-java-/V0-001-011763146-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"FL","postal_code":"33175","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"25.7311349","groups":null,"url":"http://miami.eventful.com/events/club-cameo-fridayvip-entran-/E0-001-111939309-5@2018092822?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-111939309-5@2018092822","privacy":"1","city_name":"Miami","link_count":null,"longitude":"-80.415402","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Florida","start_time":"2018-09-28 22:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" CLUB CAMEO SOUTH BEACH|FRIDAY HIP HOP PARTY|ALL INCLUSIVE PARTY PACKAGE WITH OPEN BAR, PARTY BUS TRANSFER AND VIP ENTRY.

In the project, the songwriter and multi-instrumentalist teamed up with the additional songwriting and playing contributions of Benjamin Marsh. Their collective effort is being released shortly, in the form of an eight-song album, “Sharks and Other Dangers,” which will soon be available on 12-inch vinyl, with digital options to follow. <p> <p>Working completely independent of any label or management, Bachmann chose to work on the album with his friend and collaborator David Beeman, who recorded the songs at Beeman’s own Native Sound Recording in South St. Louis. Due to Beeman’s frequent touring work with Father John Misty, there were times when “he’d be gone for up to six months,” Bachmann recalls. “But I like working with him so much that’d I’d wait to record during the times he was gone.”<p> <p>From 2008-12, Bachmann was a member of the well-regarded St. Louis shoegaze band Troubadour Dali, in which he worked previously with Marsh. Some of the tracks on “Sharks” date back to the end of their time with that project. <p> <p>“Overall, some of the songs were written around the time I left Troubadour, while the other half were written more recently,” Bachmann says. “Most of the songs are related to me, to relationships or events in my life. Benjamin’s contributions, lyrically, can be more abstract, more imagery-based. I like the blend of how he and I write. That blend is really interesting and works in a strong way. Overall, I think the sound of the music brings together our styles pretty well.”<p> <p>Expanding on possibilities of these songs live, the current stage version of Summer Magic includes a half-dozen players: Bachmann (vocals, guitar); Marsh (vocals, guitar); Mike Schurk (drums); Natalie Huggins (keys/synth/guitar/vocals); Andy Kahn (bass); and Danny Mayo (guitar). Most of the record was completed before the live band was assembled, though Schurk and Kahn make appearances on it. <p> <p>Together, the sextet create, according to Bachmann, “a good combination of upbeat, jangly tunes and some darker ones, as well.”I feel as if some of the more upbeat, poppier tunes have darker lyrics underneath them, which was not something I intentionally set out to do.” The result, overall, is a sound somewhere between Elliott Smith and The Jesus and Mary Chain.<p> <p>What <i>was</i> intended was a short-and-sweet collection of eight tracks for “Sharks,” “which,” Bachmann says, “I purposefully wanted to do. What’s left is tons and tons of other stuff. There’s easily enough music, ready to demo, for at least two more albums’ worth of material.”  <p> <p>With time, those cuts will follow their predecessors into the world. For the remainder of 2018, though, Bachmann and Company are looking to make sure that their studio wizardry finds listeners, whether on vinyl or live/onstage. <p> <p>“I’m extremely excited to finally get to share this music with everyone and am beyond enthused to see what lies ahead, both individually and collaboratively, as we move forward,” Bachmann says. “Summer Magic means the world to me and I hope it’s something that others’ make a connection with, as well.”<p> <p>Credits and biographical information for Summer Magic’s “Sharks and Other Dangers”:<p> <p>Track listing: <p>A1 Hey!<p>A2 Tracing a Bird on Construction Paper<p>A3 Charles de Gaulle in the Afternoon<p>A4 New Years Day Surprise<p>B1 Attraction Corridors<p>B2 A Certain Little Chord<p>B3 By Your Side<p>B4 Running Game<p> <p>All songs written by Kevin Bachmann, with the exception of “New Years Day Surprise,” written by Benjamin Marsh and “Running Game” co-written by Marsh and Bachmann<p> <p>David Beeman: drums<p>Benjamin Marsh: guitar, organ, piano, and lead vocal on “Running Game”;

Hawaii to Santa Rosa, California, to pursue his musical career and start his own band. For the first few months, before even having the band together, Geoff went to every concert and club show, passing out Vicious Rumors business cards, which helped to generate an interest in the music scene when the band did start finally playing out in the clubs at the end of the year. 1980/1981 - VR plays one of the first &quot;Metal Monday&quot; shows with Exodus and other bay area local bands. Metal Mondays were metal shows sponsored by the San Francisco radio station KRQR, featuring the best metal acts in the Bay Area at Bill Graham&#39;s &quot;The Old Waldorf&quot;, the premier club in the Bay Area at the time. &quot;Metal Mondays&quot; were the birth of the Bay area Metal scene! Metallica wasn&#39;t even around yet at that time! 1982 - VR appears on KMEL&#39;s &quot;New Oasis&quot; album, with the track, &quot;I Can Live Forever&quot;. The lineup: Mark Tate - vocals, Geoff Thorpe - guitar, Jim Cassero - guitar, Jeff Barnacle - bass, Walt Perkins - drums. Every VR concert around this time (1981, 1982, 1983) starts with an unexpected twist for club shows: Geoff is theatrically brought on stage in a coffin.1983 - VR releases another single on &quot;US Metal III&quot; called, &quot;Ultimate Death&quot; with Mark Tate - vocals, Geoff Thorpe - guitar, Jim Cassero - guitar, Jeff Barnacle - bass, Jim Lange - drums 1984 - VR returns to &quot;US Metal IV&quot; with the song, &quot;One Way Ticket&quot;. Geoff met Gary St.Pierre while he lived in Hawaii. Gary was singing in the band &quot;Hawaii&quot; with ex-Megadeth guitarist Mary Friedman. The line up: Gary St. Pierre - vocals, Geoff Thorpe - guitar, Chuck Moomey - guitar, Jeff Barnacle - bass, Don Selzer - drums. After the two &quot;US Metal&quot; releases, VR had built a strong Bay Area following. At this point Mike Varney offered Vicious Rumors a US deal which lead to their first professional recording contract- a 2 album deal with the now legendary Varneys Shrapnel Records. Enter Larry Howe.1985 - &quot;Soldiers of the Night&quot; was released. This album becomes album of the month in Holland and Germany. The debut line-up featured guitar prodigy Vinnie Moore. Vinnie left the band after recording the album due to musical differences. Mark McGee, formerly of Star Castle, auditions for a guitar player spot and incredible singer Carl Albert, formerly of Ruffians and Villain auditions for the vocal spot. They jammed one time and wrote the song &quot;Digital Dictator&quot; and the rest is history. Out goes Vinnie and Gary and in comes Carl and Mark. This lineup stays together for the next 8 years. 1986/1987- Touring, recording Digital Dictator1988 - &quot;Digital Dictator&quot; - VR puts out their second studio album with Shrapnel Records (Digital Dictator is released on Roadrunner in Europe). This album launches the band to an International level. Digital Dictator becomes album of the month in RockHard, one of the most respected metal magazines in the world. VR tours Europe for the first time, performing at the Aardshock Festival in front of 20 000 fans in Holland with Megadeth and the legendary Marquee Club in London, England. 1988/1989- VR goes to Mexico for the first time, the trip inspires the now classic &quot;Down to the Temple&quot; 1990 - &quot;Vicious Rumors&quot; hits the market. The success and recognition from the 2 albums on Shrapnel generates interest in the band from the major labels. VR signs a deal with Atlantic Records and puts out their self-titled album. In support of this album the band tours the US and in Europe with Death Angel and Forbidden. The band was featured on the main stage at the Dynamo Open Air Festival, in Holland in front of 25,000 fans and the band&#39;s first video for the song, &quot;Don&#39;t Wait for Me&quot; is put on rotation on MTV&#39;s, Headbanger&#39;s Ball. After returning from Europe, the bands set out on their first full US tour for 2 months. 1991 - &quot;Welcome to the Ball&quot; is released, VR&#39;s 4th album and 2nd on Atlantic Records. The band goes on a 1 month European tour with Savatage. The 2nd MTV video, &quot;Children&quot; goes beyond the exposure normally limited to metal bands on the cult Headbanger&#39;s Ball, hosted by Vanessa Warvick and Rikki Rachtman and gets regular daytime air play. And to top all of this off, VR is nominated for a &quot;Bammie Award&quot; (from Bamm Magazine) for best new metal album of the year. VR tours the US for 4 months, building and strengthening their fan base in the States. 1992 - Vicious Rumors plays Japan for the first time. &quot;Plug In & Hang On - Live in Tokyo&quot; becomes VR&#39;s first &quot;live&quot; album. VR&#39;s sold out Japanese tour is a huge success. Soon after the band returns from Tokyo, band founder and guitarist, Geoff Thorpe is diagnosed with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, a tendon disorder caused from constant repetitive movement in the hands and wrists. Geoff undergoes surgery on both hands to correct this problem. This procedure at that time was not always 100% effective and took him out of action for 9 months, the recovery period order by his doctors. In the traditional VR spirit, the band decides to put things on hold and to wait through Geoff&#39;s recovery/healing period to see if the surgery was successful. Although the band had decided to wait, Atlantic Records did not and decided to drop the band from the label. Geoff begins GTM Management during the downtime and landes the band record deals with Rising Sun Records in Germany and Alfa Music in Japan. 1993 - Geoff&#39;s hand surgery turns out to be a success and he is able to play again. Toward the end of that year, as pre-production began for their upcoming release, &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;, VR headlines their own US tour without the benefit of a record deal in that territory. Shortly after, the band fires bassist Dave Starr. Carl Albert suggests his long time friend and former band mate in Villain, Tommy Sisco, to fill the slot on bass. This new line-up was a success and went on to make more VR history for a number of years. 1994 - &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; their sixth album, is released. The lineup: Carl Albert - vocals, Geoff Thorpe - guitars, Mark McGee - guitars & vocals, Tommy Sisco - bass, Larry Howe - drums. This album generated immediate attention and put the band back on the road. In Europe, VR is back to perform at the &quot;Dynamo Festival&quot; in Holland, then joins German legends Accept for more festival dates. After the completion of that tour, VR is called back for a second European tour, this time with, Metal Church, Killers, and Zodiac Mind Warp. At the request of Rising Sun Records, VR is asked to go into the studio and record two bonus tracks to be put on a special re-released version of this album. Since this request was completely unexpected, the band had no material prepared and the recording would have to start the next day during their only days off for the remainder of the tour. Cover songs were their only option - but which ones? The band decided to go back to the roots of rock and chose two songs from the British Invasion era. The result - &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; (Led Zeppelin) and &quot;Paint It Black&quot; (Rolling Stones) learned, recorded and mixed in 1 day!! The bonus tracks were recorded in, Hanover, Germany, engineered by Steve Mann, (from MSG & Sweet) with a special appearance by Paul Quinn, (from Saxon) lending his assistance on the backing vocals for &quot;Communication Breakdown&quot;. &quot;Word of Mouth&quot; became Alfa Music&#39;s biggest seller that year! This year was extremely productive for VR, putting them back in the eye of the public and the media. The success of this album and it&#39;s US and European tours had generated rave reviews - the VR Ball was rolling once again!! 1995 - Mark McGee left the band in order to pursue change in musical direction and solo career. Geoff, Carl, Tommy and Larry began writing for the next album. For some time, the band had been considering a change in musical direction to a harder, more aggressive sound, especially Carl, and Something Burning was his opportunity to make it a reality. A lot of people are not aware that Carl and the band worked together on this sound. In fact, Carl made his biggest writing contribution of his career with VR on this album, co-writing most of the songs on it - unfortunately, Carl never got to see his dream through. Steve Smyth, a highly regarded local guitarist and friend of the band&#39;s, was the first guitarist they worked with following Mark&#39;s departure. He filled in for Mark during the writing process with Carl and the rest of the members, and eventually joins the band for touring and recording. April 22, 1995 - Carl &quot;Ace&quot; &quot;The Voice&quot; Albert one of the greatest and most talented singers in rock &#39;n roll history passed away. Even though still grieving over their loss, an important decision had to be made - What would the future be for VR? With over half of the material for the next release already written, much of it by Carl, the band felt they had no choice but to go on in Carl&#39;s memory and release his last works - and they believed that Carl would have wanted and expected nothing less. 1995 - &quot;Tribute to Carl Albert - European Bootleg&quot;, a special limited edition CD was released. The lineup: Carl Albert - vocals, Geoff Thorpe - guitars, Mark McGee - guitars, Tommy Sisco - bass, Larry Howe - drums. While in the process of writing and releasing &quot;Something Burning&quot;, which would include Carl&#39;s last writing efforts, the band still felt that this was not enough. During Carl&#39;s last tour in Europe for &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;, the band had recorded every show on a portable DAT machine with two room microphones over the sound board, specifically for their own reviewing purposes after the tour. They reviewed the recordings and decided they should be released in Carl&#39;s memory, as his final performances (with NOo studio editing/over-dubs). 1996 - &quot;Something Burning&quot; is released. The line-up: Geoff Thorpe - guitars/vocals, Larry Howe - drums, Tommy Sisco - bass, Steve Smyth - guitars. After months of auditioning vocalists, none of them felt right to the band - at this point they decided to go as a four piece, with Geoff on vocals. The end result was &quot;Something Burning&quot;, which reached #4 in Germany&#39;s top rock magazine, &quot;Rock Hard&quot;...and the band was chosen for the cover story in the February 96 edition of &quot;Heavy Oder Was&quot; magazine. Exactly one year to the day of Carl&#39;s tragic death, the band left for a six week tour of Europe with Accept on their farewell tour, and supported bands like Rainbow, Thin Lizzy, and Blue Oyster Cult at home in the States. 1997 - After a busy year or recording and touring the band felt it was time to incorporate their original sound into their future live sets and new album. Enter Brian O&#39;Connor on vocals. 1998 - &quot;CyberChrist&quot; is released. The line-up: Brian O&#39;Conner - vocals, Geoff Thorpe - guitars, vocals, Steve Smyth - guitar, Tommy Sisco - bass, Larry Howe - drums. The 9th VR album, and it marks a return to their traditional sound - a tour with Blind Guardian follows. This was the largest attendance tour VR had been on to date. The band received excellent live reviews in all major metal media outlets throughout Europe. 1999/2000 - Longtime drummer Larry Howe leaves the band to focus on his family. 2000 - Regrouping, continuous work on the new album.2001 - &quot;Sadistic Symphony&quot; is released. The line-up: Morgan Thorn - vocals, Geoff Thorpe - guitars, vocals, Ira Black - guitar, Cornbread - bass, Atma Anur - Drums. The 10th VR album. Geoff Thorpe regroups forces and is joined by a brand new lineup featuring the soaring vocals of Morgan Thorn, the electric magic of Ira Black and the bass bombardments of Cornbread, and the skins expertise of drummer extraordinaire Atma Anur (Cacophony etc.). Sadistic Symphony received impressive reviews before it&#39;s release date and will prove to be a Hallmark album for Vicious Rumors. Brian O&#39;Connor rejoins forces with VR for the live portion of Sadistic Symphony 2002-03 - &quot;The 7th Order Sessions&quot; The band decided to take a break at this point - and Geoff joined his longtime friend (from their Honolulu days) Daniel Jones for sessions with his band, 7th Order, at recording sessions in Seattle, WA. Also participating in these sessions were legendary British guitarist Martin Pugh (Steamhammer, The Rod Stewart Album, Armageddon) and drummer Tim Kelliher (Randy Hansen&#39;s Machine Gun). The end result was 7th Order&#39;s &quot;The Lake of Memory&quot; CD, which enjoyed extensive worldwide radio airplay, after being released on the Big Island Sounds label 2004 - Demo &quot;Immortal&quot; with 4 songs is released. 2005 - &quot;Crushing the World&quot;, the first Vicious Rumors DVD is released. The band announces the return of drummer extraordinaire Larry Howe to the fold. VR plays Bang Your Head open air festival in Germany.2006 - &quot;Warball&quot; is released. Geoff regroups with James Rivera on vocals, returning Larry Howe, Dave Starr and Brad Gillis (Ozzy Osbourne, Night Ranger) on guitars, delivering a release that brings back all the elements that made Vicious Rumors the highly regarded name it has maintained through the years.

in 2014 with the release of their debut EP album titled &quot;Swing Devotion&quot; in 2015. Sense the release of &quot;Swing Devotion&quot; Molina has gained attention in the music community with their influence from NY native bands &quot;Interpol&quot; and &quot;The National&quot; with enthralling guitar riffs, and ever driving bass lines, topped off with a distinct vocal range. Molina was humbled to share the stage with 80&#39;s legend Tom Keifer from the iconic band &quot;Cinderella&quot;. The response was overwhelming and sparked the band into releasing their 5 track EP &quot;Swing Devotion&quot; in late December 2015. This was the bands first time to show their true potential and Molina hoped to gain exposure locally and nationally with with their new album &quot;Swing Devotion&quot;. Sense then Molina has played countless shows gaining many loyal followers. They have obtained radio play and shared the stage with the best &quot;Up and Coming&quot; acts across the state. Molina has some big plans for the future and intend on making their music heard. Tom JoLu - Pocket Vinyl is a duo from New London, CT consisting of a one man piano slammer and an on stage painter, who creates a beautiful and unique work of art at every show. The painting is then auctioned off to the highest bidder at the end of the night. Every painting and show is one of a kind. Their new album &quot;Uncomfortably Unsure&quot; is out now. It is a very good album filled with non-sexy songs about sex. You can see a great painting video of their first single right here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn5gc1WkoPE If you&#39;d like to see Pocket Vinyl as puppets, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0VTkNWXzoM If you&#39;d like to see choreographed dancing, watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQL1A8dcKKI Or you can see a whole bunch more stuff at www.pocketvinyl.com You will not want to miss this.

Widely considered one of the founding fathers of the floor-shattering trap sound that has taken the world by storm, UZ’s innovative approach to production and impeccable reputation as a tastemaker has kept him on top of the pile for the past five years. <br><br> 2017 is possibly set to be the biggest year to date for this artist, having built such a tangible platform for himself over the past couple of years, both as a DJ and producer. Reaching five full years in the game this April, a giveaway of material from 2012-2015 hit well over 600,000 downloads – showing the consistent demand for fresh “Trap Shit” sounds, including the series of 25 tracks that fell under the same name. The likes of SPIN, Complex, Billboard and Hypetrak have offered their full support since the start, pushing his vision to a wider audience. UZ counts official remixes for the likes of Flosstradamus, Zeds Dead, 12th planet, Birdy Nam Nam, Ice Cube, Elliphant, GIA, Alvin Risk and DJ Shadow in his arsenal, whilst in 2013 he was commissioned to make a very special mixtape for Red Bull Academy. <br><br> UZ’s touring schedule continues to take him across the globe several times over, appearing in Australia, Canada, Asia, Europe, South America and South Africa. Representing bass music at its finest, he is increasingly in demand from international festivals such as Coachella, Sonar, Ultra, Stereosonic and EDC. <br> 2016 saw the start of a thrilling chapter, with UZ beginning his trap-influenced record label Quality Goods Records in April. Hand selecting the most exhilarating new music and artists, the inaugural release came from the label head himself in the form of “Magellan” EP. Other works include the UZ & Myrne remix of “Trapshit 16,” “Amazon” from Mayhem and UZ and a remix EP of the brilliantly received “Magellan.” QGR is just getting started, and as with UZ, the best is yet to com<br><br> Contact us at 415.312.3668 or <a>[email protected]</a> for reservations.<br><br> This is a 21+ event.</p></p>","modified":"2018-09-01 09:08:13","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"UZ","venue_address":"540 Howard Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-09-01 09:08:13","venue_id":"V0-001-000526718-6","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Club Temple","venue_url":"http://sanfrancisco.eventful.com/venues/club-temple-/V0-001-000526718-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Los_Angeles","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CA","postal_code":"90028","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"34.1027414","groups":null,"url":"http://losangeles.eventful.com/events/control-presents-yookie-soltan-and-mersiv-/E0-001-117635498-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-117635498-3","privacy":"1","city_name":"Los Angeles","link_count":null,"longitude":"-118.3272224","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"California","start_time":"2018-09-28 21:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Line-up /<p>LINEUP:<br> YOOKiE<br> Soltan<br> Mersiv<br><br> Locals:<br> Cedeno M3 <br> Yetch <br> Koogema<br><br> CONTROL Friday&#39;s makes a cheeky comeback to Avalon Hollywood on September 28th!
