Through 25 years together, the group’s independent music and spirit continue to resonate with its fans, and an authentic bond between the band members and their audience is evident. Blending rock, folk, Celtic, bluegrass and Americana into a high-energy style the group calls ether-electrified porch music, the Virginia quintet’s poetic songs are brought to life with acoustic & electric guitars, mandolin, fiddle, bass, drums, cello, banjo, penny whistle, pedal steel, accordion and rich vocal harmony. Writing and producing from their home studio in Richmond, VA, Carbon Leaf has released 17 albums and performed 2,400+ live shows throughout their enduring career. Andy Thomas&#39; Dust Heart Intense literary Americana murder balladry from the former Tin Horn Prayer front man turned wisened storytelling, troubadour. Dust Heart is a broody meditation that has taken Andy across the seas and around the world but still forever locked in his own head.

Detroit&#39;s oldest performance artist SATORI CIRCUS will celebrate his 30th Anniversary with performances from a 30year oeuvre of avant-garde musical theatre. On Friday and Saturday, September 28th & 29th, 2018, come celebrate this performance career milestone for two performances at The Tangent Gallery/Hastings Street Ballroom. These eclectic performances have graced the art galleries, black box spaces, streets, churches, and stages big and small in the Detroit area and throughout the U.S. SATORI CIRCUS was conceived as a one-man orchestration early in 1988, coming to fruition the fall of that year. Hard to define, this artist is not clown and not mime. Just a ball of energy, this life-force started inhabiting a myriad of characters from man to woman, to child, to things. Along with music and pantomime, film elements and words (spoken or sung), slapstick and movement and cloaked behind clown white and various facial accents, SATORI CIRCUS world came to life wherever the stage. He celebrates a performance career that has exceeded 25+ self-written/produced stage shows that included performances in 1515 Broadway, Detroit Artist Market, Scarab Club, College of Creative Studies, Detroit Institute for Arts, St. Albertus Church (a 146year old historic church), Oakland University/MeadowBrook, on Americas Got Talent and a 25 anniversary show at the Detroit Institute of Arts/Detroit Film Theatre. It has also taken him across the country to perform in Los Angeles, Chicago, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, Pittsburgh and New York. SATORI CIRCUS creative director and main performer, Russell A. Taylor has been on the scene for 38 years. Starting back in 1980 as lead singer for the rock band, The Nasties, and then as co-founder of alt-art-punk band, Fugitive Poetry in 1983. SATORI CIRCUS spoke, sung and moved for the first time at the Michigan Gallery in 1988 and found a home at the original black box-art theatre space, 1515 Broadway, Detroit. Thru the years he has been recognized for his work and has received accolades from local and national press. He won a Detroit Music Award for &quot;Outstanding Live Performance,&quot; in 1994 and in 2012. His photo has graced the cover of the Metro Times and he has been called easily the Best Performance Art Group Detroit has produced. It should be seen if only to witness a New Direction in Art. - Detroit Free Press and A love for the absurd, SATORI CIRCUS is a singularly uncanny theatre-going experience thats a little bit Performance Art and a little bit Rock Opera. - Metro Times. The 30th Anniversary show will feature some of the vignettes from his past shows such as EQUILBRIUM, MOSES:39, Child-Proof, Funy As Hell, Twilight Barks, 63mins (of random balance), poems we tell ourselves and a most recent performance art piece, Stroke. There will even be a couple surprise selections from the myriad of guest appearances SATORI CIRCUS as made throughout the years that include Theatre Bizarre (Det.), DAMNED (Det.), Dirty Show (Det.), Michigan Burlesque Festival (Det.), Atrocity (Pittsburgh), WIZBANG (Cleveland & Det.), Performance Art Festival (Cleveland) and the Erotic Poetry & Music Festival (Det.).

We aim to create and maintain A harmonious space which couples Sustainable food production and education with a community-centered haven for music and the arts. By these means we hope to cultivate an environment which strengthens the POSITIVE energy that flows through us all. Hosted on the site of Willowsong Farmstead, is a 20-acre property in Sidney, Michigan (about 1 hour northeast of Grand Rapids, northwest of lansing and mount pleasant). It boasts a lovely pond, plenty of aged willows (gee... wonder where the name came from... wink, wink) , apple trees, a large organic garden and plenty of fresh air. Hosting the annual Willowsong Music Festival and owned by The Raby Family. Days Festivities: Gates open at 2:00pm on Friday the 28th - attendees will want to arrive early to choose their campsite and set up shop before the festivities begin. Camping and parking are included at no charge. No ground fires or fireworks allowed on premises, we will have a community fire for everyone. Please reach out in advance with an email to willowsongfarm@gmail.com for special accommodations like limited mobility or RV parking.  A new band will take the stage approximately every hour until the last band begins at 10:00pm. There will be plenty of space to enjoy the live music as well as food vendors, local artists and festival merchandise. We hope to have an hourly raffle for neat stuff like Willowsong Swag and Artist Merch. After the last stage show, campers can gather around the rather large fir pit for some relaxing acoustic campfire tunes. The event will proceed rain or shine with enough tent space for everyone to cozy up in the event of foul weather calamities. End of the Evening After a fun filled day, camping is strongly encouraged. Don&#39;t drink and drive! Please stay tuned! More details will roll out as the date approaches. Like our sponsors, food vendors, art vendors, festival activities and bands! Can&#39;t wait to announce as we are receiving many inquiries already. Hope to see you all in September!
