Exploring broken relationships, sordid characters, and unfortunate events, Tragic Jack delivers original Rock/Pop songs performed with conviction and groove. \n\n&quot;...a predominantly piano-driven sound that combines characteristics of Amsler’s indie rock and Hull’s blues, with straightforward song structures, bouncy piano and guitar progressions and Hull’s emphatic, Jagger-esque vocals.&quot; Daily Nebraskan \n\nThe project was born in the summer of 2013, when Hull and Amsler began writing together on Sunday afternoons at Silver Street Studio in Ashland, Nebraska. Amsler, fresh off a one-time reunion show with his former major label band The Millions, was interested in developing new material and getting back on the stage. Hull, owner of Silver Street Records, was keen to advance years of songwriting and production into a live band with a big sound. \n\n&quot;Their balanced pop-rock melodies ride through keys, guitar and cello. Hull’s vocals are rich and blues centered, with lyrics full of romance and conviction. &quot; - KZUM 89.3 \n\nOver the next three years and many Sunday afternoons, Hull and Amsler slowly crafted a diverse catalog of original songs flavored by the Rock, Soul, Gospel, Jazz, Indie, and Pop influences of the writing duo. \n\n“...their dynamic range really sets them apart. They’re not a one volume, one type of song/sound type of band.” Eli Mardock, Owner and Talent Buyer at The Royal Grove. \n\nIn the summer of 2016, Hull and Amsler rounded out the Tragic Jack live sound with the addition Lance Lehman on guitar and Brent Vignery on drums. The group recorded their debut album ‘Glasshouse Town’ in the spring of 2018 with plans for a fall release.\n\nDoors at 8:00pm \nFront Room\n$5 Advance/$7 Day of show\n\nAll ages show. \nCheck entry requirements at http://theslowdown.com/All-Ages\n\nMore info and music at http://www.tragicjack.com","modified":"2018-09-12 12:56:35","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Tragic Jack w/ Soul Ghost, Brad Hoshaw","venue_address":"729 North Fourteenth Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"charlesahull","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/041/168/059-9.jpeg_/tragic-jack-w-soul-ghost-brad-hoshaw-59.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/medium/I0-001/041/168/059-9.jpeg_/tragic-jack-w-soul-ghost-brad-hoshaw-59.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/041/168/059-9.jpeg_/tragic-jack-w-soul-ghost-brad-hoshaw-59.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/thumb/I0-001/041/168/059-9.jpeg_/tragic-jack-w-soul-ghost-brad-hoshaw-59.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2018-09-12 12:56:35","venue_id":"V0-001-000553490-9","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2018-09-28 23:30:00","venue_name":"The Slowdown","venue_url":"http://omaha.eventful.com/venues/the-slowdown-/V0-001-000553490-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"FL","postal_code":"33139","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"25.7865858","groups":null,"url":"http://miami.eventful.com/events/september-2018-live-musi-/E0-001-117920044-3@2018092819?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-117920044-3@2018092819","privacy":"1","city_name":"Miami Beach","link_count":null,"longitude":"-80.129663","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Florida","start_time":"2018-09-28 19:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Now the longest running live music events on Miami Beach, The Betsy’s (mostly jazz) Live Music Series has been featuring Miami&#39;s top jazz musicians and vocalists for more than 8 years.

If you saw the Oscar-winning film, The Decendants you have experienced this great acoustic guitar tradition. Kimo is a 2008 winner of the Hawaii Music Awards and three time Na Hoku Hanohano (the Hawaiian Grammy) nominee. He is also a two-time winner of the LA Treasures Award for his efforts in keeping this important acoustic guitar tradition alive. For his work with Weird Al, he has earned four Grammys and a Billboard #1 CD debut for 2015s Mandatory Fun. *All sales final, no refunds.<br> <br> \n","modified":"2018-09-15 02:36:59","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Jim Kimo West","venue_address":"525 Kumquat Court","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-08-18 03:05:59","venue_id":"V0-001-002122888-6","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2018-09-28 22:30:00","venue_name":"WSLR Radio,","venue_url":"http://sarasota.eventful.com/venues/wslr-radio-/V0-001-002122888-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Denver","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NM","postal_code":"87301","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"35.529243","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/gallup/events/fatal-corruption-testify01-ethnic-generation-born-wi-/E0-001-118047140-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-118047140-9","privacy":"1","city_name":"Gallup","link_count":null,"longitude":"-108.738454","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New Mexico","start_time":"2018-09-28 18:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":null,"modified":"2018-09-14 21:09:33","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Fatal Corruption- Testify01- Ethnic De Generation- Born Of Winter- Condemn the World","venue_address":"310 E HWY 66","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-09-14 21:09:33","venue_id":"V0-001-009639824-4","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Juggernaut Music","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/gallup/venues/juggernaut-music-/V0-001-009639824-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"FL","postal_code":"32118","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"29.2340259","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/daytonabeach/events/side-hustle-ajeva-/E0-001-118046719-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-118046719-6","privacy":"1","city_name":"Daytona Beach","link_count":null,"longitude":"-81.0163741","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Florida","start_time":"2018-09-28 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":null,"modified":"2018-09-14 21:03:01","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Side Hustle- Ajeva","venue_address":"308 Seabreeze Boulevard","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-09-14 21:03:01","venue_id":"V0-001-010680545-8","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Rok Bar","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/daytonabeach/venues/rok-bar-/V0-001-010680545-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Indiana/Indianapolis","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"IN","postal_code":"10336","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"41.1793613","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/fortwayne/events/band-cheyenne-dustin-castle-/E0-001-118046669-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-118046669-2","privacy":"1","city_name":"Fort Wayne","link_count":null,"longitude":"-85.074339","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Indiana","start_time":"2018-09-28 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Crush House Recording Artist TBC Single Release and Fan Appreciation Party.

rel=\"nofollow\">Stranger Tickets</a><br><br> A multi-ethnic, female-led seven-piece, <a href=\"http://www.encantobrazil.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">En Canto&#39;s</a> world pop music—a combination forró, samba, and choro-inspired originals and reimagined covers of classic Brazilian hits—commands attention and inspires movement. “We love this music because of its compositional brilliance, its original grooves, and its revolutionary nature ... its roots in post-colonialism, in cultural battles for class and racial equality,” Accordionist Jamie Maschler, explains. &quot;Why wouldn’t it also inspire gender-equality?&quot; <br><br> Playing primarily in North American venues, En Canto currently channels its fierce independence into challenging stereotypes while also helping audiences expand their comfort zones. “We make people dance,” as drummer Adam Kozie puts it “We routinely open our concerts to a room full of shy, awkward faces, and we close them to a sweat-drenched melee of bodies and smiles. We experience real joy when we play these songs, and people feel that, and they respond in kind, regardless of whether they understand the words or know the ‘right’ dance moves. It was the same for each us at one point when we first heard Luis Gonzaga or Gilberto Gil—we were provoked and then captured by the music, and we feel honored to be able to offer our own interpretations of it.” <br><br><b>Please note:</b> Forró Night with En Canto and dance class included with Brazilian dance instructor <b>Erika Magno</b>. <br><br> Learn the basics or try some new steps with Erika then enjoy dancing to live music with En Canto! <br><br><a href=\"http://www.encantobrazil.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a><br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/encantobrasil\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a><br><a href=\"https://twitter.com/encantobrazil\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a><br><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/encantobrazil/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instagram</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1862347843858890/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook Event</a><br><br><i>Please note: Tickets do not guarantee seating during shows at the Royal Room.
