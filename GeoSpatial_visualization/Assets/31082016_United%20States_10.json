Information on how you can participate in “Skeletons from the Closet: A Silent Auction for Deadheads” is below. Performers announced so far in addition to Allen include Mark Karan, Roger McNamee, David Gans, Jordan Feinstein, Maurice Tani, Paige Clem, Michael Berry, Amy Berry, Mike Meagher, Joe Balestreri, Pamela Brandon, Jimmie Brighton, and Totally Dead. Jerome John Garcia would have turned 74 on August 1. Although his body is gone, the Grateful Dead guitarist’s spirit and music have never been more alive. That spirit is the heart of tonight’s tribute, celebrating Garcia the composer and performer, as soloists, duos, and bands perform separately and in kaleidoscopic combinations, acoustic and electric, and both at once, in this community benefit for Ashkenaz. Although Jerry Garcia never played at Ashkenaz, his music has a long history with the venue. Since the ’90s Ashkenaz has hosted Grateful Dead Nights, featuring a plethora of musicians who worked with him over the decades, as well as bands that pay homage to the music of Jerry Garcia, the Grateful Dead, and scores of acts who follow in their footsteps. New to this year’s “Very Jerry” is “Skeletons from the Closet: A Silent Auction for Deadheads.” Calling all Deadheads – we need your stash! Perhaps there is some nugget or treasure you are ready to part with in support of Ashkenaz? Books, LPs, concert posters, and other gems and paraphernalia are welcome! Or, perhaps you are a musician who can offer a service for auction, or know a business owner you can approach about a gift certificate? Items can be dropped off at any Grateful Dead Night between now and August 31, or contact Ashkenaz to arrange an alternate dropoff or pickup. Donations are tax-deductible and will help keep your local Dead Night community center keepin’ on! Another new feature this year that we are excited to announce is a special pre-show celebration dinner: a Soulful Summer three-course vegetarian meal prepared and served by Club Ave 9’s Jeff “da Chef” Rosen. Come get some good eats and good seats! Dinner ticket holders will be allowed early entry into the venue, with dinner seating in the main hall beginning at 7:00 pm and ending promptly by 8:00. Tickets for dinner and the show are $35, with a portion of dinner proceeds also going to benefit Ashkenaz. The dinner menu:– Organic Heirloom tomato salad with avocado, arugula, castelvetrano olives, feta cheese, polenta “croutons” and green goddess dressing– Wild mushroom, sweet white corn, Rancho Gordo bean and sweet and spicy summer chile hand pie with salsa verde– White peach and olallieberry crisp with whipped cream This is a Community Benefit Night to raise funds for Ashkenaz, the all-ages world dance hall. Beginning with a salute to Bob Dylan’s 70th birthday in 2011, musicians have donated their time and talents in a creative and inspiring series of tributes, every few months honoring a different musician, band, or year, and supporting the nonprofit local institution that is Ashkenaz Music & Dance Community Center.

Through an immersive collaboration between Glass Animals and artists Whoopi and Myk, the event will bring to life the diverse group of fictional characters featured on the album, inspired by real people the band encountered while touring over the past 2 years.\n\nRSVP here: https://glassanimalstumblrirl.splashthat.com/","modified":"2016-08-24 09:12:19","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Tumblr IRL with Glass Animals","venue_address":"1616 Butler Avenue","geocode_type":"Zip Code Based GeoCodes","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"winnie_brantonb598c","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/031/998/920-4.jpeg_/tumblr-irl-glass-animals-20.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/031/998/920-4.jpeg_/tumblr-irl-glass-animals-20.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/031/998/920-4.jpeg_/tumblr-irl-glass-animals-20.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/031/998/920-4.jpeg_/tumblr-irl-glass-animals-20.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-08-24 09:12:19","venue_id":"V0-001-010561998-8","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Village Studios","venue_url":"http://losangeles.eventful.com/venues/the-village-studios-/V0-001-010561998-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Denver","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CO","postal_code":"80302","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"40.0194329","groups":null,"url":"http://denver.eventful.com/events/watchhill-/E0-001-095945091-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095945091-3","privacy":"1","city_name":"Boulder","link_count":null,"longitude":"-105.2730802","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Colorado","start_time":"2016-08-31 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" 8-11 PM","modified":"2016-08-24 14:11:47","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"The WatchHill","venue_address":"1709 Pearl Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2016-08-24 14:11:47","venue_id":"V0-001-001465788-6","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Laughing Goat Coffee House","venue_url":"http://denver.eventful.com/venues/the-laughing-goat-coffee-house-/V0-001-001465788-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NJ","postal_code":"07027","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"40.6544990","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/karen-mansfield-/E0-001-095944714-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095944714-0","privacy":"1","city_name":"Garwood","link_count":null,"longitude":"-74.3185580","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New Jersey","start_time":"2016-08-31 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Opening for Pat DiNizio of the Smithereens","modified":"2016-08-24 14:05:16","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Karen Mansfield","venue_address":"78 North Ave","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2016-08-24 14:05:16","venue_id":"V0-001-000334548-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Crossroads","venue_url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/crossroads-/V0-001-000334548-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NY","postal_code":"10010","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"40.7401","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/comedy-water-hosted-ray-d-/E0-001-095741551-8@2016083101?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095741551-8@2016083101","privacy":"1","city_name":"New York","link_count":null,"longitude":"-73.9805","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New York","start_time":"2016-08-31 01:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" M.I.T.

Ed’s path to his original and progressive Bass Music Sound was burgeoned by his early creative efforts as a graffiti writer.The iconic UFO! sound began in the streets of San Francisco’s early urban 90’s Electro Break’s scene. Adopting vinyl and turntables, UFO!’s formative innovation into turntablsim quickly progressed into audio production. The UFO! sound captured aninternational audience with the first American Drum & Bass breakthrough album, “The Future is Listening”. Transforming Bass Music was an unintentional side effect of UFO!’s interpretation of the era’s Rave Music scene.Having established a career of innovations within the Bass Music scene under the moniker of UFO!, a happenstance collaboration with Bro Safari, resulted in the breakthrough album “Future Primitive”. This album defined the future of Moombahton. The collaboration with Bro Safari progressed, erupting with the release of the breakthrough and influential Trap album of 2014, “Animal”. UFO!, still to this day pushes the envelope of innovation in Bass Music, influencing and collaborating with some the top artists in the scene. To hear more and get a glimpse of what he has in store for the future, we invite you to came see and hear it for yourselves.https://soundcloud.com/itsufohttps://www.facebook.com/ItsUFOhttps://twitter.com/ItsUFOhttps://www.instagram.com/its_ufoPerforming alongside UFO! will be some of Cleveland’s legendary DJ’s that have been pushing the sounds of Bass Music since the early days of the Cleveland Electronic Music scene.

Embracing an inclusive approach to music-making, the SOB seeks to democratize both \u2028the production and reception of concert music. Founded in 2007 by artistic director Eli Spindel, the String Orchestra of Brooklyn is “quickly solidifying its role as a major orchestral figure in the borough” (I Care if You Listen), providing an enriching creative outlet to hundreds of musicians, and accessible, adventurous programming to thousands of concertgoers and community members.\nPraised for its passionate commitment to the music of our time by The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, I Care if You Listen, Cool Hunting, and more, the SOB places a special emphasis on the work of living composers. 2015 highlights have included a 6-hour performance/installation for the new Whitney Museum in collaboration with Tony Conrad and John Cale, and being featured on Richard Carrick’s newly released album Cycles of Evolution. The orchestra has presented world premieres by such composers as Anthony Coleman, Judd Greenstein, Katherine Young, Alex Mincek, Catherine Lamb, Scott Wollschleger, Christopher Cerrone, and many more. Upcoming commissions include the work of Baltimore composer Alexandra Gardner for the SOB’s annual String Theories Festival in spring of 2016.\nThe orchestra, which seeks to increase its impact in the community through artistic \u2028and institutional collaborations, has collaborated with numerous vital Brooklyn-based organizations, including Roulette, ISSUE Project Room, American Opera Projects, GHOSTLIGHT Chorus, loadbang, the Fort Greene Park Conservancy, and the Noel Pointer Foundation. Guest soloists and conductors have included such stars as Tito Muñoz, Charlers Neidich, Steve Beck, Matt Boehler, David Kaplan, Spencer Myer, and the Toomai String Quintet.\n***\nWilliam Brittelle is a Brooklyn-based composer of post-genre electro-acoustic music. His primary musical mentors include Pulitzer Prize-winning composer David Del Tredici, Mike Longo, longtime pianist/arranger for Dizzy Gillespie, and punk guitarist Richard Lloyd of Television.  Brittelle’s work is characterized by the melding of complex thematic ideas, rhythms, and formal structure with the visceral power and surface appeal of pop/rock music, a duality perhaps best represented by his most recent album Loving the Chambered Nautilus. Written specifically for the players of ACME (the American Contemporary Music Ensemble), Nautilus is a series of electro-acoustic chamber music pieces melding classic synthesizer sounds and drum programming with virtuosic and textured classical composition. The album has been hailed as a hallmark of the next wave of classical composition. Following an All Things Considered feature, Nautilus hit #1 on Amazon’s Chamber Music Chart. The New York Times labeled the work “bright and joyous”, and MUSO dubbed it “a fast, fun, freedom-fuelled flurry of a record”. Perhaps most powerfully, Classical TV stated: “William Brittelle is creating a body of work that has no precedent, and marks him as a one of the most promising heirs of the vital American maverick tradition.”\nPrevious to Nautilus, Brittelle released Television Landscape, his fully-composed, post-apocalyptic art rock concept album scored for orchestra, rock band, synths, and children’s choir.  Dubbed “irresistible” by The New York Times and “a glorious reclamation of lush sounds crusty critics have vilified for years” by Time Out NY, Television Landscape drew substantial praise from both rock and classical critics, leading the Los Angeles Times to muse, “You might wonder if Jane’s Addiction had discovered the soul of Debussy.” eMusic called the album “expansive, anthemic, all-encompassing, shot through with raw emotion” and named it to its ”Albums of the Year” list. The album’s centerpiece, the nostalgia-soaked soft rock ballad Sheena Easton, was singled out by Popmatters for its “complex orchestrations” and “mind-bending arrangements” and taste-maker rock blog My Old Kentucky called the track “one of the more interesting tunes I’ve heard in a while.” The Believer magazine chose the album’s closing track The Color of Rain for inclusion in its prestigious annual music issue.\nBrittelle’s music has been the subject of features in The New York Times (Sunday Arts & Leisure), the Los Angeles Times, Time Out NY, and NPR’s All Things Considered.  His compositions have been presented across the U.S. and internationally., including the Festival Internacional in Chihuahua, Mexico, the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires by JACK Quartet, Pittsburgh’s Music on the Edge series, Seattle’s Town Hall, and the Ecstatic Music Festival at Merkin Hall. His music has been commissioned by the Seattle Symphony, the Indianapolis Symphony, the Baltimore Symphony, the Walker Art Center, the Alabama Symphony and the Eastern Connecticut Symphony. Recent commissions include Spiritual America, a series of electro-acoustic orchestral art songs featuring the band Wye Oak, Love Letter for Arca for the Seattle Symphony, and Psychedelics for the Grammy-winning vocal group Roomful of Teeth and the Williams College Chorus. Past collaborative works include orchestral arrangements for the electronic artists Oneohtrix Point Never and Son Lux. Recent and upcoming performances include dates with the Baltimore Symphony, the Basel Sinfonietta, and the Liquid Music Series/Walker Art Center.\nBrittelle has been the recipient of grants and awards from the National Endowment of the Arts, American Music Center, American Composers Forum, the Jerome Foundation, the Foundation for Contemporary Arts, NYSCA, and ASCAP.  Along with composers Judd Greenstein and Sarah Kirkland Snider, he co-artistic directs New Amsterdam, a vital Brooklyn-based record label and presenting organization.  He is a passionate promoter, presenter, and producer of new and adventurous music in New York City, having overseen the release of more than 70 critically acclaimed recordings. Along with his partners, Brittelle also co-produced and co-presented more than 90 live music events throughout the U.S. in the last four years. He serves on the faculty of The New School in New York City, teaching courses in Post-Genre Music and the Ethos of Punk.","modified":"2016-08-10 13:45:12","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"String Orchestra of Brooklyn feat.

of phenomenal beauty” (Stephen Holden, New York Times), Jane Monheit has had plenty of milestone moments in establishing herself as one of today’s best and most important vocalist-musicians.<p>With her new album, The Songbook Sessions: Ella Fitzgerald—the Long Island native has surprised even herself with her artistic leap. Jane had thought about recording an Ella tribute for a long time. Fitzgerald’s beloved songbook albums held “Biblical” importance for her when she was growing up and have never lost their hold on her.<p><br> On this new offering, Monheit pays joyous tribute to Ella while sharing a definitive portrait of herself, guided by her producer, arranger, and trumpet great, Nicholas Payton. Once she decided to make the dream project a reality, she had no trouble choosing titles. She jotted down a list of 25 titles “almost immediately.” She and Payton each narrowed the choices to a dozen and settled on the final list together.<p>Throughout the recording, Jane’s gorgeous upward swoop is pure Ella, her earthy wordless phrases pure Sarah, but this album is a classic example of a singer leading her influences rather than being led by them.<p>The Songbook Sessions was recorded during a tumultuous time for Monheit, who had suffered several shakeups in her personal life. The most painful was the death of her grandfather, her biggest fan and most devoted coach, who often would put together lists of the songs he wanted her to record and printed out the lyrics for her. Among those songs was Irving Berlin’s “I Used to Be Color Blind,” the one song she had to learn for the album. Her grandfather died before he could hear her version, but clearly, his spirit was in the room. “Like the artist that she is, instead of cowering away from life situations that were quite painful, Jane put that into the music,” says Payton<p>As the arranger of eight of the songs, Payton also updated the harmonies and overall feel of several of the tunes. “I wanted to make them romantic and sexy,” he says. “We look at love and sex a lot differently today than we did 60 years ago.” Longtime band mates, pianist Michael Kanan and bassist Neal Miner, who each arranged two songs, also made contributions to the fresh arrangements on the album.<p>Jane Monheit was born on November 3, 1977. She was raised in Oakdale, New York, on Long Island’s South Shore. Her aunt and grandmother were professional singers. Her mother performed in musical theater and currently performs in local choirs, and her father plays banjo and guitar. His love of bluegrass, folk, and acoustic blues (Bonnie Raitt and Maura O’Connell were among his favorites) shaped her musical sensibility. “It all came down to storytelling,” she says.</p></p></p></p></p></p></p>","modified":"2016-07-01 21:15:58","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":[{"creator":"chris_radcliff","linker":"evdb","name":"Jane Monheit","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Jane-Monheit?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000029374-2","short_bio":"jazz/pop vocalist"},{"creator":"berkleebassist","linker":"evdb","name":"Nicholas Payton","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Nicholas-Payton?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000046859-5","short_bio":"One of jazz's brightest trumpet stars"}]},"title":"Jane Monheit w/Nicholas Payton","venue_address":"1010 Nicollet Mall","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/336/556-3.jpg_/jane-monheit-56.jpg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/000/336/556-3.jpg_/jane-monheit-56.jpg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/336/556-3.jpg_/jane-monheit-56.jpg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/000/336/556-3.jpg_/jane-monheit-56.jpg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-07-01 21:15:58","venue_id":"V0-001-001312852-7","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Dakota Jazz Club & Restaurant","venue_url":"http://minneapolis.eventful.com/venues/dakota-jazz-club-restaurant-/V0-001-001312852-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Los_Angeles","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"WA","postal_code":"98121","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"47.6134044","groups":null,"url":"http://seattle.eventful.com/events/violent-soho-sunset-meat-wave-mutiny-mutiny-/E0-001-093413334-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-093413334-1","privacy":"1","city_name":"Seattle","link_count":null,"longitude":"-122.3443448","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Washington","start_time":"2016-08-31 19:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" This event is 21 and over <br>Violent Soho<br><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.violentsoho.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a><li><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/violentsoho\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a></li></li></ul><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.thecrocodile.com/event/1183071-violent-soho-sunset-seattle/#tfly-more-1\" rel=\"nofollow\">Links</a></li></ul><br>It was ages back that we started a band.

The new album mixes traditional Irish music with modern influences, creating a sound that&#39;s as wide-ranging as the band&#39;s own audience.\n\nFrom bluegrass fans and country cowboys to Deadheads, rock & rollers and Celtic fanatics, Gaelic Storm has built one of the most diverse fan bases in modern music. Matching Sweaters helps explain the broad appeal. Rooted in the songwriting of founding members Patrick Murphy and Steve Twigger, the album moves from drinking songs (&quot;Another Stupid Drinking Song&quot;) to energetic instrumentals (&quot;The Narwhaling Cheesehead&quot;) to rootsy pop/rockers (&quot;Whiskeyed Up and Womaned Out&quot;), gluing everything together with the spark and spirit of a band that&#39;s spent close to 20 years on the road.\n\n&quot;We&#39;re a touring band,&quot; says percussionist Ryan Lacey, who joined the lineup in 2003. &quot;That&#39;s how this band works.Matching Sweaters is one of the most complete albums we&#39;ve done so far, because it taps into every facet of our live show.&quot;\n\nThose live shows date all the way back to the mid-1990s, when Gaelic Storm kicked off its career as a pub band in Santa Monica, California. By the end of the decade, the musicians had appeared in the blockbuster film &quot;Titanic&quot; (where they performed &quot;Irish Party in Third Class&quot;) and laid the groundwork for a career that would eventually find them topping the Billboard World Chart five times, making appearances at mainstream music festivals such as Summerfest, Telluride and The Rock Boat Cruise, and regularly headlining the largest Irish Festivals across the country, all the while gaining a reputation as a genre-bending Irish band whose songs mix Celtic traditions with something new and unexpected. Now, with the band&#39;s 20th anniversary on the horizon, they&#39;re putting even more emphasis on those newer directions.\n\n&quot;We&#39;ll push the envelope, then reel it back in, then push it again,&quot; says Murphy. &quot;There&#39;s a lot of variety here, and that&#39;s why we can play country festivals, bluegrass festivals and rock festivals, and still fit in perfectly with each one. We wanted Matching Sweaters to reflect that range, so people could buy the CD and hear everything we&#39;re able to do in concert.&quot;\n\nWhen it came time to write Matching Sweaters&#39; 12 songs, Murphy and Twigger teamed up with longtime friend and co-writer Steve Wehmeyer. Together, the three found inspiration in everything from old Irish newspapers (&quot;The Rustling Goat Gang,&quot; whose details were gleaned from an article about a vanishing goat herd from Waterford) to bits of conversation overheard in local pubs (&quot;Paddy&#39;s Rubber Arm&quot;).\n\nIn addition to writing new songs, the musicians have continued to play new markets every year, taking the chance to stretch their boundaries — and widen their audience — whenever possible. It helps keep them on their toes.\n\n&quot;Playing for a new crowd is great,&quot; says Twigger. &quot;It takes you back to those early days, where you&#39;ve got something to prove. We could just do Irish festivals, but why not play a crossover show where 90% of the audience doesn&#39;t know you, and you have to make them know you? That&#39;s what makes your band good.&quot;\n\nMatching Sweaters follows in that hard-working tradition, dishing up all the ingredients fans have come to expect from Gaelic Storm — the drinking songs, sea shanties, furiously-strummed instrumentals and sing-along melodies — while spiking the mix with newer flavors. Eat it up, but make sure to save some room! There&#39;s plenty more where this came from.","modified":"2016-07-19 15:07:42","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"girlillamarketing","linker":"evdb","name":"Gaelic Storm","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Gaelic-Storm?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000014398-8","short_bio":"On Tour NOW!"}},"title":"Gaelic Storm","venue_address":"300 President Clinton Avenue","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"stickyrevolution18692","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/029/619/893-0.jpeg_/gaelic-storm-93.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/029/619/893-0.jpeg_/gaelic-storm-93.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/029/619/893-0.jpeg_/gaelic-storm-93.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/029/619/893-0.jpeg_/gaelic-storm-93.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-07-01 22:17:57","venue_id":"V0-001-000219941-3","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Revolution Music Room","venue_url":"http://littlerock.eventful.com/venues/revolution-music-room-/V0-001-000219941-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Chicago","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"IL","postal_code":"60607","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"41.884637","groups":null,"url":"http://chicago.eventful.com/events/garfunkel-oates-630-pm-show-/E0-001-093385756-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-093385756-9","privacy":"1","city_name":"Chicago","link_count":null,"longitude":"-87.6570519","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Illinois","start_time":"2016-08-31 18:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <strong>About:</strong><br><p>Riki Lindhome and Kate Micucci met at the Upright Citizens Brigade theatre in Los Angeles in 2007 and formed Garfunkel and Oates, named after the &quot;two famous rock-and-roll second bananas&quot; Art Garfunkel and John Oates, shortly thereafter.

folk, and classic, compelling Americana Rock. Emblematic of artists like Ryan Adams, My Morning Jacket, and Tom Petty,Tahoma boasts a flawless blend of indie-rock, Americana-soul, and classic rock n’ roll.The Austin, TX group’s newest single “Emerald Ring” perfectly emulates the band’s transformation from wine-sipping romantic folk to definitively, classic American rock music. The first single from the group’s upcoming record (set to be released in June 2016), “Emerald Ring” is an expression of lead singer, Brandon Aguilar, “coming to terms with what kind of songwriter I think I am”. Superbly written lyrics, detailing the painfully natural process of human growth, coupled with tasteful, melodically crafted guitar riffs places Tahoma into their own distinct realm of hybrid Americana Rock. Joining Aguilar is Sarah Oermann on backing vocals/percussion, Vinnie Fallico on lead guitar, Mark Mayfield on bass, and Clellan Hyatt on drums. Oermann’s soulfully chilling harmonies coupled with Fallico’s electrifying, gritty guitar licks makes for an eye-turning, energetic sound reminiscent of 70’s LA country rock legends Jackson Browne, Joni Mitchell, and The Eagles.While the group still maintains a fingerprint of their older, folk roots from their debut Honest Mark EP, Tahoma has re-crafted their sound with a live, full band in mind. When asked of the group’s progression, Aguilar noted “it’s always been easier for me to write a rock song… that’s more me at the very core.” With a full length album set for a June 2016 release, Tahoma is geared up, and ready to showcase their distinctly unique brand of Americana Rock to audiences everywhere.

Rascal began his multi-instrumentalist career in the family basement, learning guitar and drums and playing alongside his older brother. Throughout school, Rascal continued to develop his craft and began writing his own music, which channels an eclectic mixture of Americana and Folk. Early recordings of the duo were done in the family basement using free software and a few shoddy microphone stands. <br> Ceasing every opportunity to perform, Rascal began playing basement shows to mostly family and friends. His insatiable appetite to perform and passion for the craft grew along with his love of making people happy through his music. After graduating high school in 2012, Rascal entered college and continued writing and performing around the Midwest. <br> The young crooner released his self-titled EP, &quot;The Long Road&quot; in August, 2013. Rascal followed this with single, &quot;I Love You Anyway&quot; in August, 2014. Rascal&#39;s most recent self-titled LP, &quot;The Original (Acoustic Sessions),&quot; was released in May, 2015.","modified":"2016-07-29 23:20:55","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Harbor And Home - Tahoma - Rascal Martinez","venue_address":"3131 Walnut Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/015/877/304-2.jpeg_/harbor-and-home-tahoma-rascal-martinez-04.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/015/877/304-2.jpeg_/harbor-and-home-tahoma-rascal-martinez-04.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/015/877/304-2.jpeg_/harbor-and-home-tahoma-rascal-martinez-04.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/015/877/304-2.jpeg_/harbor-and-home-tahoma-rascal-martinez-04.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-07-29 23:20:55","venue_id":"V0-001-000167382-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Walnut Room","venue_url":"http://denver.eventful.com/venues/the-walnut-room-/V0-001-000167382-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Chicago","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"IL","postal_code":"62523","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"39.8432","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/decatur_il/events/girls-night-out-show-/E0-001-095314923-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095314923-7","privacy":"1","city_name":"Decatur","link_count":null,"longitude":"-88.9519","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Illinois","start_time":"2016-08-31 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":"Ladies!!
