As the calendar pages have turned for over a quarter of a century now, this poet laureate of the folk and roots music world has gone about his work with a combination of passion, intent and intensity, and curiosity. Fusing his insatiable appetite for finding the next unique storyline Keelaghan also forges his pieces with brilliantly defined craftsmanship and a monogrammed artistic vision, making him one of the most distinctive and readily identifiable voices of not only the Canadian scene, but as a member of the international singer-songwriter community. Armed with a songbook that has enlightened and enthralled, and been embraced, by audiences around the world, Keelaghans life as an artist is one that is a perpetual journey on so many levels. Most importantly its a journey that has invited fans of literate and layered songwriting to be a part of his artistic expeditions, some that weave their way through marvelously etched stories of a historical nature with underlying universal themes, and others that mine the depths of the soul and the emotional trails of human relations.¨His masterful story telling, over the course of nine recordings, has been part of the bedrock of his success, earning Keelaghan his share of nominations and awards, and acclaim from Australia to Scandinavia.The necessity to write has always been a double-edged sword. Ive always had the urge to write. Some things werent being said in the way I wanted to say them. Then there are the different sides of what I write about. The narrative writing, the historical material, as well as the personal, where you have to take responsibility for what you are saying, says the Calgary native who has been calling Winnipeg home for the past few years.A disciplined visionary, Keelaghans aces have long been a love of language, and history, as he earned a history degree years ago, his skills as a thespian that he acquired at an early age, that explain his ability to make an immediate connection with audiences in a live setting, and an ear for a memorable melody, and harmonies that make those melodies glisten. Im good for 80 or so books a year, mostly history, non-fiction, but inspiration can come in many forms, Im always on the lookout for a good story or idea. My sister told me the story that became Kiris Piano. It was such an image, says Keelaghan, that visits a dark chapter in Canadian history, Japanese interment camps in the Second World War. Not only does his deep catalogue include timeless originals like Fires of Calais, Cold Missouri Waters, Jenny Bryce, Hillcrest Mine, and Kiris Piano, Keelaghan is also a possessive interpreter of outside material. A fine example being his gripping take on Gordon Lightfoots epic Canadian Railroad Trilogy on the Lighfoot Tribute disc Beautiful. There are a number of illustrations of his interpretive skills on his 2006 recording A Few Simple Verses. The closing tune on that spellbinding set, My Blood written with Jez Lowe, is one of many examples in Keelaghans career, where he has invited collaboration into his creative process. I was at the Celtic Colors Festival in 2008 and the producers locked six of us in a house for a week, and the company included Dave Gunning, David Francey, and Rose Cousins, it was an amazing experience. We had to come up with enough material for a show at the end of it. To go along with a lifelong accumulation of influences, there have been these opportunities to work with equals, whether it be Oliver Schroer, Hugh McMillan, or Oscar Lopez. The sparks of collaboration, batting melodies back and forth, whatever, have produced some wonderful results, says the artist who ties it all together with a powerful voice, delivery, and a commanding presence where he finds a balance between examining the lighter and heavier sides of life. For Keelaghan staying at the top of his game comes down to a very clear rule, never stop accumulating. I want my audiences to know that I am open enough to try new things and push their bounds. It was Dave Marsh, the award-winning American music critic and historian who not so long ago stated that James Keelaghan is Canadas finest songwriter, and those few but powerful words of praise say it all about an artist who continues to set the bar at a lofty height. <a href=\"http://jezlowe.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><b>Jez Lowe</b></a> has built an enviable reputation as a songwriter and performer in the world of acoustic music, and as a recognized musical ambassador for his native North East England, with almost twenty albums and countless live performances around the world over the last thirty years. Among those who have recorded their own versions of <b>Lowe</b>s songs are Fairport Convention, The Unthanks, The Dubliners, The Tannahill Weavers, Cherish The Ladies, Gordon Bok, Tom McConville, The McCalmans, The Black Brothers, Liam Clancy, Bob Fox and literally hundreds of others. Songs like BACK IN DURHAM GAOL, THE BERGEN, GREEK LIGHTNING and THESE COAL TOWN DAYS have generated scores of cover versions around the globe, and are now classics of their kind. He has performed at some of the most prestigious venues in the world, both solo and with the Bad Pennies, including the main stages at Edmonton Festival (Canada), Tønder Festival (Denmark), The Kennedy Center and the Smithsonian (US), Port Fairy and Byron Bay Festivals (Australia) and at concerts and festivals in New Zealand, Hong Kong, Ireland, Holland, Germany and Spain. In 2008, <b>Jez</b> was nominated as Folksinger of the Year in the BBC Folk awards, following the success of his album JACK COMMONS ANTHEM the previous year. After a retrospective live collection, entitled NORTHERN ECHOES (winner of the Indie-Acoustic Award for Best Lyrics in 2009), 2010s follow-up CD, entitled WOTCHEOR! surpassed that success, and has become <b>Jez</b>s most popular album yet, spawning a series of special stage-shows and UK tours based on the themes of the album, to great acclaim. Last year also saw the release of a compilation of 18 essential Jez Lowe songs entitled HEADS UP, containing some of his best-known compositions, such as THE BERGEN, BACK IN DURHAM GAOL, THESE COAL TOWN DAYS, GREEK LIGHTNING, and LONDON DANNY, plus bonus collaborative tracks with James Keelaghan and Vin Garbutt. <i>Doors open at 7:00 pm.

Gruenling is a contemporary harmonica masterimpressive, genuine and fresh-sounding. Living BluesChicago guitarist, vocalist and songwriter Nick Moss is a bona fide bluesman down to his soul, a 30-year veteran of the citys take-no-prisoners blues scene. Moss paid his dues gigging in Chicagos rough and tumble West and South side blues clubs under the tutelage of some of the citys greatest blues luminaries. Blues Revue says, Nick Moss is at the top of the blues world...ambitious and intense...He can play traditional blues with the best. New Jerseys Dennis Gruenling is considered among todays best blues harmonica players. His high-energy, full-throttle playing has earned him comparisons to the late James Cotton. Living Blues says, Dennis Gruenling is a contemporary harmonica master...impressive, genuine and fresh-sounding. Now, recording together for the first time, The Nick Moss Band Featuring Dennis Gruenling makes their Alligator Records debut with The High Cost Of Low Living, a dream come true for both musicians.The High Cost Of Low Living is a tour de force of the classic Chicago blues ensemble sound Moss and Gruenling know, live and love. But its no recycling of old songs. Moss wrote eight memorable new originals and Gruenling wrote two, all deeply rooted in the blues tradition with a touch of old school rock n roll. Produced by guitarist Kid Andersen and Moss and recorded at Rancho de Rhythm in Elgin, Illinois, the album is a joyous sonic blast of pure blues power.Although Moss and Gruenling had known each other for 20 years and had jammed together often, it wasnt until 2016 that they decided to team up full time. Moss deeply rooted yet fully modern guitar playing flawlessly meshes with Gruenlings monster harmonica chops. On stage, the two communicate seemingly telepathically, as Moss lays down the deepest blues licks and Gruenlings harmonica wails and howls in perfect response, with Moss top-notch band adding their energy and expertise to the ensemble.According to Alligator president Bruce Iglauer, Nick and Dennis are a natural fit for the label. Its very exciting to bring artists to Alligator who are so deeply rooted in the Chicago blues tradition, but creating fresh new songs to carry that tradition forward. Nicks a thrilling guitar player, a gritty, honest singer, and his band is tough as nails. Dennis is a blues harmonica master and a terrific showman. This is a partnership of two world-class talents in one band. These are artists that any fan of the blues has got to love.Moss is equally thrilled, saying, I am extremely excited and honored to be a part of Alligator Records legacy. It was 35 years ago that I got my first Alligator recordingBlues Deluxeand 31 years ago that I saw my first Alligator act, Little Charlie & The Nightcats, in person. My life has never been the same!Growing up in Chicago and standing tall at 62, Moss dreamed of playing both music and sports. When kidney surgery sidelined his athletic hopes, he dove headfirst into the blues. His mother was a huge blues fan, even taking a young Nick to see bluesmen like Muddy Waters live in concert. Originally a bass player, Moss got his first professional break touring and playing bass with legendary West Side Chicago guitarist Jimmy Fast Fingers Dawkins. He next toured with Willie Big Eyes Smith (longtime Muddy Waters drummer), leader of the Legendary Blues Band. Finding himself in need of a guitarist, Smith insisted Moss switch instruments. Combining his natural talent with non-stop woodshedding and playing every open jam session, Moss quickly became one of the citys most highly sought-after players. Bluesman Jimmy Rogers (famous for his pioneering guitar work with Muddy Waters and for his solo hit Walking By Myself) hired Moss to join his touring band and became his mentor. Moss other influences include B.B. King, Freddie King, Earl Hooker, Magic Slim and other groundbreaking players.Moss formed his own band in 1997 and released the first of his 12 solo albums a year later on his own independent Blue Bella label. Hes received 21 Blues Music Award nominations and has earned legions of fans around the world, playing over 100 shows a year. Moss has shared stages with Buddy Guy, Kenny Wayne Shepherd, Gary Clark, Jr., David Hidalgo and many others, and is an in-demand guest, always welcome to sit in with his musician friends around the world. Elmore calls him one of the best guitarists on the scene today.As a teen, Gruenling heard the Alligator recording Harp Attack! (a summit meeting of James Cotton, Junior Wells, Carey Bell and Billy Branch) and decided that blues harmonica was his lifes calling. In addition to Cotton, Gruenling was inspired by blues harp masters Little Walter and George Harmonica Smith as well as by saxophonists, including Lester Young and Red Prysock. A self-taught player and a natural entertainer with seven solo albums to his credit, Gruenlings giant, fat-toned harp work, raw-boned singing and untamed energy are a perfect foil for Moss hair-raising guitar playing and straight-from-the-shoulder blues vocals.With the release of The High Cost Of Low Living, The Nick Moss Band Featuring Dennis Gruenling will do what they do best: barnstorm the globe, bringing their muscular, high-energy show to clubs, concert halls, roadhouses and festival stages night after night. It is a show that is not to be missed. According to Moss, Im a shy person, but when the band and I get on stage, the music takes over. We cant hold back and the energy just comes pouring out. We get carried away and the audience gets carried away with us.","modified":"2018-08-06

This is a hands-on workshop, so if you&#39;re interested in creating instead of just watching, bring your charged Windows or Mac laptop loaded up with the following software: 1. Unity 2018.2.4f1 2. PureData 0.48-1 3. Context Sequencer (follow the instructions on this page after you&#39;ve installed PureData) 4. GAB_PD_Unity_Workshop.zip (note: this has been tested on Mac 10.13.6, and Windows 10 64 bit) Over the past two decades in music Michael Sweet is an accomplished video game audio composer for more than 100 video games. Michael currently leads the development of the game scoring curriculum at Berklee College of Music. As a composer/sound designer his latest games include Walden, A Game about the life of Henry David Thoreau, and The Night Journey an experimental art game which tells the story of an individual’s journey towards enlightenment.

The concerts Dan offers are not just a performance of his music, but an evening of stories, prayer and reflection woven around his songs. People who&#39;ve attended these events have commented that it feels more like a retreat than a concert. And that&#39;s the effect Dan hopes to create. &quot;The music is not about &quot;Dan Schutte,&quot; but about the faithful God who loves us unconditionally.&quot; Dan is the first to admit that the songs he&#39;s written belong to communities of people who have sung them for many years. Throughout the evening he provides plenty of opportunity for people to join in the singing of his beloved melodies. Join us for an evening of sung prayer with Dan. He will offer a workshop on Saturday, Sept. 29th from 9:00 am – 1:00 pm.

Don&#39;t miss out! Please note that this event is 21+ San Jose: September 28Berkeley: September 29 (bit.ly/Vanic) About Vanic: Vancouver-based producer Vanic (aka Jesse Hughes) first caught listeners&#39; attention with a string of well-received remixes -- including his reworking of machineheart&#39;s &quot;Circles&quot; -- before releasing his own trap- and house-influenced tracks. Hughes began playing piano when he was three but grew bored with the confines of his classical training, and soon dabbled in jazz and ragtime piano while listening to metal and happy hardcore. He started by remixing well-known tracks, and released his debut as Vanic -- a version of Taylor Swift&#39;s &quot;I Knew You Were Trouble&quot; -- in 2012. His career gained momentum with remixes of Birdy&#39;s &quot;Skinny Love&quot; and machineheart&#39;s &quot;Circles,&quot; a pair of 2014 tracks that earned him millions of streams. More viral remixes of artists such as Lana Del Rey, Chvrches, Major Lazer, and the Chainsmokers followed, and Vanic signed a deal with Sony&#39;s Disruptor Records in 2016.  Vanic: soundcloud.com/djvanicfacebook.com/djvanicinstagram.com/djvanictwitter.com/djvanic Supporting Acts: BEAUZ+ More TBA Set Times: To Be Announced ","modified":"2018-09-19 09:09:54","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"evdb","linker":"evdb","name":"Vanic","url":"http://eventful.com/performers/vanic-/P0-001-014179727-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-014179727-5","short_bio":null}},"title":"Vanic at Aura Night Club - California Dreams","venue_address":"389 South 1st Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/040/838/824-8.jpeg_/vanic-aura-night-club-california-dreams-24.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/medium/I0-001/040/838/824-8.jpeg_/vanic-aura-night-club-california-dreams-24.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/040/838/824-8.jpeg_/vanic-aura-night-club-california-dreams-24.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/thumb/I0-001/040/838/824-8.jpeg_/vanic-aura-night-club-california-dreams-24.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2018-08-10 07:30:19","venue_id":"V0-001-009304830-2","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"AURA NIGHT CLUB","venue_url":"http://sanjose.eventful.com/venues/aura-night-club-/V0-001-009304830-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"Pacific/Honolulu","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"HI","postal_code":"96817","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"21.3115454","groups":null,"url":"http://honolulu.eventful.com/events/spooky-couch-downbeat-lounge-/E0-001-117975567-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-117975567-9","privacy":"1","city_name":"Honolulu","link_count":null,"longitude":"-157.8622","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Hawaii","start_time":"2018-09-27 21:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":"Indie rock group Spooky Couch plays Downbeat Lounge with special guests\n\nSeptember 27\n9pm\n21+\nNo Cover\n\nDownbeat Lounge\n42 N Hotel Street\nHonolulu, HI 96817\n\nFeaturing members of Sing the Body and MonoTrio, indie rock group SPOOKY COUCH is making a name for themselves with rollicking shows in and around Honolulu, HI.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/spookycouch/","modified":"2018-09-14 04:33:16","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Spooky Couch at Downbeat Lounge","venue_address":"42 N Hotel St","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"info77364","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/041/169/908-3.jpeg_/spooky-couch-downbeat-lounge-08.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/medium/I0-001/041/169/908-3.jpeg_/spooky-couch-downbeat-lounge-08.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/041/169/908-3.jpeg_/spooky-couch-downbeat-lounge-08.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/thumb/I0-001/041/169/908-3.jpeg_/spooky-couch-downbeat-lounge-08.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2018-09-13 03:55:26","venue_id":"V0-001-006779857-8","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2018-09-28 00:00:00","venue_name":"Downbeat Diner & Lounge","venue_url":"http://honolulu.eventful.com/venues/downbeat-diner-lounge-/V0-001-006779857-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Detroit","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"MI","postal_code":"48152","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"42.4109514","groups":null,"url":"http://detroit.eventful.com/events/claude-bourbon-/E0-001-116493008-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-116493008-1","privacy":"1","city_name":"Livonia","link_count":null,"longitude":"-83.4277674","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Michigan","start_time":"2018-09-28 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Ready for a unique and talented take on a wide range of musical traditions? Claude Bourbon is known throughout Europe and America for amazing guitar performances that take blues, Spanish, and Middle Eastern stylings into uncharted territories. Claudes inimitable style incorporates all five digits on each hand dancing independently but in unison, plucking, picking and strumming at such speed and precision that his fingers often seem to melt into a blur. Thousands of people in the UK, Europe and USA have enjoyed listening to this virtuoso and for the majority of his audience it is an experience that compels them to return again and again to hear and watch him play, as his fingers lightly dance over the strings of his guitar and create a unique sound that is Claude. It is very hard to describe the almost endless amalgam of different influences in Claude&#39;s playing, all melting into each other, as he moves from classical openings, across a whole continent of cultural roots, from the Balearics to the Balkans, and then across to the Mississippi Delta, and shoehorned into all that is music that would not have been out of place in the courts of Emperors and Kings. Claude Bourbon weaved his songs through the audience as if on a journey through life taking in different flavours of Europe and beyond. His Spanish medieval blues evolved into Gypsy, Eastern European, with a splash of Paco de Lucia, Delta Blues and more. Holding audience attention under a musical spell. It&#39;s not easy to begin to describe the breadth or mastery of the music you will hear if you are fortunate to catch one of Claudes gigs, it is a sort of sensory experience like no other. A top master of his craft and never appearing to be rushed, he has impeccable timing and makes things that one can only marvel at seem simple. Now based in the UK, some of this guitarists influences allow us a fascinating insight into this remarkable musician; Paco De Lucia: Deep Purples Richie Blackmore; Joaquin Rodrigo; JJ Cale; JS Bach. Claude has played countless venues, including Glastonbury Festival, Isle of Wight Festival, Colne Great British & Blues Festival, Rock O&#39;Z Arene, Avenches, Switzerland, among others. He has shared the stage in Europe and the USA with countless musicians, Calvin Russel, Charlie Morgan (Elton John, Gary Moore), Jan Akkerman (Focus), Steve Grossman (Miles Davis), Herbie Armstrong ( Van Morisson), Jose barrense Dias and many more.<br> <br> \n","modified":"2018-07-24 02:34:04","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"escoate","linker":"evdb","name":"Claude Bourbon","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Claude-Bourbon?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000104214-5","short_bio":"\"solo fingerpicking acoustic guitarist\""}},"title":"Claude Bourbon","venue_address":"38840 Six Mile Road","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/001/663/954-7.jpeg_/claude-bourbon-54.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/medium/I0-001/001/663/954-7.jpeg_/claude-bourbon-54.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/001/663/954-7.jpeg_/claude-bourbon-54.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/thumb/I0-001/001/663/954-7.jpeg_/claude-bourbon-54.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2018-07-24 02:34:04","venue_id":"V0-001-000238671-8","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2018-09-28 22:30:00","venue_name":"Trinity House Theatre","venue_url":"http://detroit.eventful.com/venues/trinity-house-theatre-/V0-001-000238671-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Los_Angeles","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CA","postal_code":"95959","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"39.261547","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/nevadacity/events/evening-dirtwire-karavan-sarai-brian-hartman-/E0-001-117794623-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-117794623-1","privacy":"1","city_name":"Nevada City","link_count":null,"longitude":"-121.016096","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"California","start_time":"2018-09-28 21:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" ..The Stone House Presents...

But on The Lamb, her sophomore LP and debut for Hardly Art, she has found strength in vulnerability. Through bracing hooks and sharp lyrics, the 24-year-old songwriter and guitarist illustrates a nuanced look on her own adulthood—her fraught insecurity, struggles with addiction, and the loss of several people close to her. A staple in the Chicago music scene, LALA LALA is now well on their way to make their well-deserved mark on the world. Our pals in DEHD (formally known as DREAM EAGLE HEAVY DREAMS) return after their wickedly sold out miracle release show in December last year. We have the amazing ERIC McGRADY behind the kit, with JASON BALLA (NE-HI/EARRING), and SUPERMAGICAL&#39;s EMILY KEMPF completing the trifecta of awesome-sauce. Described as a “serene hum of swaying rhythm in simplistic, beautifully-put phraseologies” by Impose Magazine, these locally acclaimed garage rockers juxtapose harsh garage with warm sun-kissed melodies. Hot off a national tour with DC indie band FLASHER and opening for Philly&#39;s Palm in August, it&#39;s always a dang pleasure to welcome these cats back on our stage.CHORAL REEFR is back and they’re bringin’ the stoner angel vibes with their blissful experimental pop. This solo project evolved from the front woman of old school rock n&#39; rollers THE SHAKIN BABIES into the powerhouse stoner-diva she is today. Rooted in R&B and electronica, CHORAL REEFR blends shimmering percussion with deeply ethereal and atmospheric vocal production. Let her stone cold groove wash over you like a hot seaside wave at sunrise.

At the time Dub Phizix, (or George to his mum) was just someone who annoyed the neighbours. By 10 years into his career of music construction, Dub Phizix was an accomplished producer having made music in a variety of styles for MTV, BBC, Nokia and 4Music. Forward to today and Dub Phizix has released music on high profile and respected labels such as Exit, Soul:R, Critical, Metalheadz, Ingredients and many more with Mixmag calling his music Essential material. The Dub Phizix remix portfolio is also impressive with reworks for Atlantic Records (Charli XCX), Hospital Records (Netsky), Basement Jaxx, Sizzla, Kelis / Breach and many more. 2011 saw the total domination of the Drum and Bass scene from a tune called Marka. Penned by Dub Phizix alongside regular collaborator Skeptical with guest vocals from Strategy (of Broke n £nglish), Marka adhered to no known recent stylistic formulas. Having reached 4 million views on Youtube, 2011 and 2012 will be remembered for the impact Marka has had on not just drum and bass, but electronic music in general. Dub Phizix has traversed the globe and taken his unique sound to all six continents including shows and tours across the US, India, China, Brazil, South Africa, Australia and more as well as being one of the most in demand DJs across the UK and playing nearly every major city in Europe with appearances at major festivals including Exit, Global Gathering, Outlook, Boomtown and many more. In 2014 Dub Phizix set up his own imprint, Senkasonic, to provide a home for his own productions and give him full creative control and influence over every aspect of the release. The first SenkaSonic release, Buffalo Charge featuring Strategy, turned heads with its unique and award winning video concept and caused widespread damage as a huge festival tune in 2014. November 2015 saw the release of his Fabric Live Mix CD to critical acclaim with Resident Advisor including it in their Top 10 official mixes for the year. He followed that up by starting a BBC Radio 1 residency in January with his partner in crime, Strategy. Hes got a lot up his sleeve for 2016 with more releases on SenkaSonic, more radio shows and more touring the world with his sets crammed full of brand new, exclusive solo productions. ++~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~++ STRATEGY Estate Recordings /Broken £nglish / UK ++~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~++ People love Strategy. Raised on the Costa Del Salford and honing his craft in some of Manchesters most notorious nightclubs, STraTS has made contributions right across the board when it comes to UK music. From his part in BrokeN£nglish alongside fellow northerners DRS and Konny Kon who shared stage and studio time with names such as the Wu-Tang Clan, Mobb Deep, Roots Manuva, Snoop Dogg and many more, to his work in the UK bass music scene collaborating with and hosting for artists Dub Phizix, Mala, Zed Bias and Calibre to name but a few...everybody knows Strategy. Known for his adaptability, Strategy has done it all, from being rap battle finalist at Earls Court London at the Jay Z concert, to performing with Digital Mystikz at Northern Bass Festival in New Zealand. His ability to rhyme on the spot is on a par with any freestyler on the globe; long recognised as one of the finest spitters the UK has ever produced. The last few years have seen Strategy evolve and adapt to the ever-changing UK Music scene. Becoming a resident at Manchesters Hit & Run has exposed him to a lot of the key players, and news travelled fast about the classiness of his act. In a short amount of time, he has ended up with regular work at clubbing institutions like Fabric, Soul:ution, Outlook Festival and Warehouse Project, as well as a busy world-wide touring schedule. Once witnessed in his element, promoters are quickly on the phone to re-acquire his services. The track Marka with long-time collaborator Dub Phizix, and Skeptical, was the biggest 170bpm anthem in years, championed by the likes of Sir David Rodigan, Mista Jam, Friction, Goldie, and many more. After touring the world together Dub Phizix and Strategy went back into the studio and came back with the mighty Buffalo Charge. Another dance floor killer, which demonstrated they are both far from being one hit wonders. With a shed-load of new music on the way and a new BBC Radio 1 residency alongside Dub Phizix, 2016 and beyond is looking bright for our STraTS! ++~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~++ HEISTY Sublimate Records / PDX ++~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~++ A Pacific Northwest native, Heisty has been involved in the DnB and Bass Music scene for going on 5 years as a founding member and resident DJ of the Portland based music collective and record label, Sublimate. Sublimate has been hosting their monthly event series since mid 2014 and currently holds down their monthly residency at The Liquor Store. Heisty and the rest of crew have their fingers to the pulse of the underground bass music scene pushing sounds from Dnb, Halftime, Jungle, Dubstep, Footwork, Grime, West Coast Bass, and beyond.

BACON is a 7 Piece touring Appalachian Funk, Grass and Rock & Roll band. Blending incredibly diverse instrumentation with broad, deep musical influences, allows the band to perform a plethora of widely accessible, danceable music. The Dr. Bacon Live Experience is truly a spectacle to behold, bringing the audience on a musical Journey that lulls and spikes in energy, caressing ears with lush beauty and whipping crowds into a tribal romp, shaking booties and shedding inhibitions. This manic versatility ensures that no matter what genre of music you identify with most, you will hear something that resonates. Dr. Bacon started playing together in 2012 on King Street in Boone as a 3 piece busking with acoustic bluegrass, folk, and 90s pop/rock/hip-hop influenced music. Several lineup changes over the years and a move to Asheville have refined and redirected the bands sound, incorporating funk, rock, soul, psychedelic and world music to Appalachian influences. The blending of several elements of these genres (often within the same song) along with unique instrumentation is the real Bacon flavor. Dr. Bacon now tours regularly up and down the east coast. web: http://www.drbaconband.com/vid: https://youtu.be/ymue3OFt37U Arson Daily Starting in 2014, North Carolina natives Arson Daily effortlessly work hard and play harder. Done so by making music and performance professionalism their main focus, in proper rock n’ roll fashion. The trifecta of talent (comprised of vocalist/guitarist Zach Dunham, bassist Quincy Platt and drummer Adam McLean) has locked in an unique alt-party psych-rock sound. Comparable to the rage of Cage the Elephant, Arson Daily continues their quest with a second full length album (due late 2018). Getting their early start performing in packed basement shows, the months spent playing these shows would only contribute to their growth as professional musicians. It’s essential to let their energy encapsulate the listener, holding them hungry for the next show. Their most recent release, an EP titled “What’s On Your Mind” (June 2017) encaptures the essence that is Arson Daily. With split-step sounds complimented by chill-wave call-and-release, it’s your road trip go to. The trio is notable for taking their sound across several genres, which is showcased in “What’s On Your Mind”. The vox-garage styles of Dunham’s vocals coupled with Platt’s golden-groove bass licks and the complex, creative sounds of McLean’s percussion create the revolution that is Arson Daily. When put up against the world, music like Arson Daily can teleport you to a tropical brit-rock reservoir. Their storytelling abilities showcase the sentimentality that even an extroverted three piece can provide when given the chance to. For listeners looking to walk like a badass, throw on Arson Daily to put some party pep in your step. web: http://www.arsondaily.comvid: https://youtu.be/Wulf8IfrHsg C2 & The Brothers Reed&quot;Hailing from the Bluegrass with a sound as unique and smooth as the regions&#39; beloved bourbon, C2 & The Brothers Reed&#39;s authenticity shines in their studio debut Weigh Station Tour. After the independent release of their first EP &quot;Hot Mess&quot;, along with an extensive tour schedule (250+ shows in 2015-16) traveling mainly in the southern part of the country, they took to the studio less than a year later to cut their new record Weigh Station Tour. Split into sides, &#39;Exit A&#39; &#39;Exit B&#39;, Weigh Station Tour explores gritty rock and roll while referencing 60&#39;s and 70&#39;s era soul music, embracing a style that is nearly lost but deeply needed in the surge of modern sound and technology. The band - singer/bassist Cameron Clark, guitarist Kelly Reed, drummer Kody Reed, and keyboardist James Weishar - hide behind nothing on their records, with a &#39;realness&#39; that has been constantly attributed to their live performance. Since forming in 2013, C2 & The Brothers Reed have made some notable appearances across the board with acts such as Stone Temple Pilots&#39; Scott Weiland, Moon Taxi, Eddie Money, Warrant, and jam bands The Werks and Dopapod. &quot;Weigh Station Tour: Exit A&quot; was released in January 2015 and the followup &quot;Exit B&quot; released summer of 2016.&quot;web: https://www.c2andthebrothersreed.com/vid: https://youtu.be/xXXIamxwq7A ","modified":"2018-09-27 07:26:06","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Dr. Bacon w/ Arson Daily and C2 & The Brothers Reed | Asheville Music Hall","venue_address":"31 Patton Avenue","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/040/713/455-2.jpeg_/dr-bacon-w-arson-daily-and-c2-brothers-reed-ashe-55.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/medium/I0-001/040/713/455-2.jpeg_/dr-bacon-w-arson-daily-and-c2-brothers-reed-ashe-55.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/small/I0-001/040/713/455-2.jpeg_/dr-bacon-w-arson-daily-and-c2-brothers-reed-ashe-55.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://d1marr3m5x4iac.cloudfront.net/images/thumb/I0-001/040/713/455-2.jpeg_/dr-bacon-w-arson-daily-and-c2-brothers-reed-ashe-55.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2018-07-19 13:10:50","venue_id":"V0-001-004968223-7","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Asheville Music Hall","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/asheville/venues/asheville-music-hall-/V0-001-004968223-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"}]}}
