The Seattle-area resident simply strips songs to their essence on the new recording. “I spend a lot of time developing new contexts like the barnyard electronics aesthetic,” Barnes says. “Get Myself Together was my last acoustic-type recording and I get quite a bit of fan mail about it, but the label that released it went out of business. I wanted to make something with this record that featured more of my raw acoustic sound, as though I was kind of playing in your living room.”<p>Folks notice Got Myself Together (Ten Years Later), released November 27 on Eight 30 Records, delivering Barnes trademark story songs and impeccable banjo picking over and again on the album (“Rat’s Ass,” “Cut a Rug”). “Danny Barnes’ musical horizon is vast and elegant,” says legendary Texas songsmith Robert Earl Keen, who frequently enlists Barnes as banjoist in his touring band. “I’ve said many times that he is the world’s greatest banjo player. Danny’s singing swoops and soars by still waters and down rocky paths.” “It is heaven and earth,” says superstar Dave Matthews, who also frequently calls Barnes to bat in his live show. “It is Americana from the back porch to the pulpit.”<p>Longtime fans immediately will recognize Barnes’ quirky lyrics and unimpeachable banjo style jumping toward the fore with little distraction on the new record. “I had to come up with a different scene for each song,” Barnes says. “The original context for these songs was as though I had made a movie and everything was all committed to celluloid. However, with music you tend to shape things as you play them live. The routine: You write something, you record it, then you go play it for ten years on the road. So, in returning to the music, I had a different perspective. It’s more like a dramatic work in that the company that performs it and the venue it’s performed in necessarily changes the meaning.”<p>Icing on the cake: The Temple, Texas native – and this year’s Steve Martin Excellence in Bluegrass and Banjo winner – offers a buoyant bonus track rerecording of his former band the Bad Livers’ high watermark “I’m Convicted.” The song’s equally rambunctious and robust. “Danny Barnes doesn’t sound like anyone else,” says iconic instrumentalist Bill Frisell, whose “Big Shoe” closes out the album proper. “I was knocked out when I first heard him play and continue to be.” “I enjoy these songs and I think they are ‘real songs,’ if that makes any sense,” Barnes concludes. “They can be strummed on a one-string instrument and they still make sense and tell the story. They don’t depend on effects or processing. I think they are worth a busy person taking time to jam on them.”<p>For more information, visit <a href=\"http://www.dannybarnes.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">dannybarnes.com</a>.<p>With <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/milesovermountainsband/?fref=ts\" rel=\"nofollow\">Miles Over Mountains</a></p></p></p></p></p></p></p></p>","modified":"2016-07-16 15:38:08","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"pscott1","linker":"evdb","name":"Danny Barnes","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Danny-Barnes?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000138451-9","short_bio":"banjo/guitar virtuoso"}},"title":"Danny Barnes -  Miles Over Mountains","venue_address":"1859 Monroe St.","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2016-07-02 03:46:50","venue_id":"V0-001-007024668-6","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Crescendo Espresso Bar","venue_url":"http://madison.eventful.com/venues/crescendo-espresso-bar-/V0-001-007024668-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Chicago","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"MN","postal_code":"55408","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"44.9544600","groups":null,"url":"http://minneapolis.eventful.com/events/rock-your-rights-feat-murder-shoes-bruise-v-/E0-001-095020248-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095020248-3","privacy":"1","city_name":"Minneapolis","link_count":null,"longitude":"-93.2783280","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Minnesota","start_time":"2016-08-31 19:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <p> <p> <p> <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=\"http://www.prochoiceminnesota.org/\" rel=\"nofollow\">more info</a><br><br><p><strong>Rock for your Rights is a concert to raise money and awareness about reproductive rights in Minnesota!  NARAL Pro-Choice Minnesota is a grassroots movement focused on guaranteeing every woman the right to make personal decisions regarding the full range of reproductive choices, including preventing unintended pregnancy, bearing healthy children, and choosing legal abortion.  We accomplish this through public education, citizen lobbying, and pro-choice voter mobilization.

Shortly after Derek Van Gieson first moved to Minneapolis, he met fellow guitarist Chris White through an ex-post-hardcore-punk pal. For a year or so, Derek and Chris stockpiled hundreds of songs. The songs ran the gamut of 60s pop/garage nuggets, gothic folk, chaotic post-punk, 80s funk and R&B, country/western, shoegaze, rockabilly, and surf. It could have been a real hot mess, but Derek brought Tess Weinberg in to the picture and she tied the whole thing together with her sultry cross-genre vocals. They further refined their sound as a trio and just when they thought they had it figured out, bassist Tim Heinlein and drummer Elliot Manthey brought the volume, power, and muscle.<p>Inside of a year as a quintet, Murder Shoes recorded and released three EPs, a full length album, and went on tour. After many adventures in the studio and live, the band has refined the eclectic nature of their sound, which can now accurately be described as “Murder Shoesy.”<br>\\n&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6_gwiPGVMk&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:854,&quot;height&quot;:480,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;YouTube&quot;,&quot;thumbnailUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Q6_gwiPGVMk/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;}&quot; data-block-type=32 id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1468432200655_37261&quot;&gt;<br><br><br><br>&quot; data-provider-name=&quot;YouTube&quot;&gt;<br><br><p><p> <p> <p> <p> <br><strong>Bruise Violet:</strong><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bruisevioletmn\" rel=\"nofollow\">artist website</a><br><br><p> Bruise Violet is an &quot;angry harmonic grunge punk&quot; band, made up of the members Emily, Bella, and Danielle.

It&#39;s like Broadway meets Bikini Kill.<br>\\n&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RzvXPJIKtY&quot;,&quot;width&quot;:854,&quot;height&quot;:480,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;YouTube&quot;,&quot;thumbnailUrl&quot;:&quot;https://i.ytimg.com/vi/4RzvXPJIKtY/hqdefault.jpg&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;youtube&quot;}&quot; data-block-type=32 id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1468432200655_83919&quot;&gt;<br><br><br><br>&quot; data-provider-name=&quot;YouTube&quot;&gt;<br><br><p> <p> <p> <p> <p> <br><strong>The Long Odds:</strong><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/The-Long-Odds-288635201301547\" rel=\"nofollow\">artist website</a><br><br><p>The Long Odds are a well-rounded and experienced lineup consisting of former members of Minneapolis alt-country band Western Fifth and local Big Star cover band, Big Gurls and current bass player for local Minneapolis band, Murder Shoes. Rooted in classic country, bluegrass, and folk rock, original songs mix soothing vocal harmonies, dark ambient electric guitar, and rich organ sounds while being driven steadily by a thick, hard hitting rhythm section. Members are MIssy Heinlein - Vocals, Keys/Tim Heinlein - Vocals, Guitar/Jonas Lader - Vocals, Drums/Mike Fruncillo – Bass Guitar/Jason Streitz - Vocals, Guitar.<br>&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://soundcloud.com/thelongodds&quot;,&quot;resolvedBy&quot;:&quot;soundcloud&quot;,&quot;floatDir&quot;:null,&quot;authorName&quot;:&quot;TheLongOdds&quot;,&quot;version&quot;:1,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;TheLongOdds&quot;,&quot;resolved&quot;:true,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;rich&quot;,&quot;providerName&quot;:&quot;SoundCloud&quot;,&quot;description&quot;:&quot;Minneapolis Americana&quot;,&quot;providerUrl&quot;:&quot;http://soundcloud.com&quot;}&quot; data-block-type=22 id=&quot;block-yui_3_17_2_1_1468432200655_79099&quot;&gt;<br><br><br><br><br><p> <p> <p> <p> <br><strong>Lakewood Cemetery:</strong><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><a href=\"https://lakewoodcemetery.bandcamp.com/releases\" rel=\"nofollow\">artist website</a><br><br><p>Lakewood Cemetery is an indie folk duo comprised of Minneapolis locals Dan Krzykowski and Katrina Schleisman.

ALL AGES. Seated show. <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/uncleearlband/?fref=ts\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.facebook.com/uncleearlband</a><br><p>Fearless ambassadors for stringband music, Uncle Earl use tradition as a springboard, coloring a vast and varied legacy with their own unique perspectives as vocalists, instrumentalists, and songwriters. Independently, Kristin Andreassen (guitar, fiddle, ukulele, harmonica, vocals, clogging), Rayna Gellert (fiddle, guitar, vocals), KC Groves (mandolin, guitar, bass, vocals), and Abigail Washburn (banjo, vocals), have each emerged as adventurous, compelling voices in the ongoing old-time renaissance. Together, their undeniable chemistry, charisma, and formidable combination of talents made them a fan and festival favorite both at home in the U.S. and abroad. <p>Over the course of many productive years together, Andreassen, Gellert, Groves, and Washburn introduced new audiences to the timeless beauty and limitless potential of traditional American old-time music, while inspiring the explorations of the next generation of roots musicians. A pair of striking releases on eclectic roots music imprint Rounder Records brought their take on stringband music to the pages of such influential outlets as Rolling Stone, the New York Times, and Mojo. <p>Tireless national touring and a pair of self-released EPs made Uncle Earl a word-of-mouth favorite at festivals and listening rooms, and brought them to the attention of Rounder Records – who released She Waits for Night in 2005. Produced by old-time maverick Dirk Powell, the album consolidated the group’s many strengths and helped establish a national following for the group. On the festival circuit they encountered stringband music enthusiast and former Led Zeppelin bassist/keyboardist John Paul Jones, who produced the band’s widely acclaimed 2007 follow-up, Waterloo, Tennessee. Rolling Stone cited Uncle Earl in its list of “The New Bluegrass: Five Acts to Watch,” calling Waterloo “their most ambitious [album] yet, mixing traditional fiddle-powered jams and rich four-part harmonies with countrified covers of classics and old-time ho-downs.” <p>Following the intense touring in support of Waterloo, Tennessee – which took them everywhere from the BBC to Bonnaroo – the individual members resumed their solo pursuits full-time. Groves and Andreassen have occasionally reconvened Uncle Earl with the help of some of the finest female performers in old-time music, and in 2016 the Andreassen/Gellert/Groves/Washburn lineup reunites for a handful of very special performances.<p><strong>w/ Anna & Elizabeth</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.annaandelizabeth.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.annaandelizabeth.com/</a><br><p>A collaboration between Anna Roberts-Gevalt and Elizabeth Laprelle, the pair’s growing acclaim springs from a shared quartet of talents: Both are historians, storytellers, visual artists, and gifted, intuitive musicians—in combination, a groundbreaking approach.<br> ​<br> Inspired by the richness and tradition of the music, Anna & Elizabeth gather songs and stories from archives and visits with elders. They bring these songs to life in performance with sparse, atmospheric arrangements using guitar, banjo, fiddle, and the uncanny blend of their voices in close harmony. They accompany their songs with stories—of the lyrics, of the singer, of the quest to learn the song—and they illustrate them in mesmerizing fashion. The two revive the old scrolling picture show, dubbed “crankies”—intricate picture-scrolls illustrating the old songs they sing, which they create in tandem with papercuts, shadow puppets, prints, and embroidered fabric.<p>Anna & Elizabeth met in 2011, and their work has brought them to stages across the world, including the Atlanta Museum of Modern Art; folk festivals in Brooklyn, the Yukon, Chicago, Maine, and Uzbekistan; residencies at universities; summer traditional music schools; and small theaters and folk clubs across the U.S. and U.K.<p>Their second album, which features Grammy nominee and legendary folk singer Alice Gerrard, was released March 2015 on Free Dirt Records. It has been featured on Vice’s Noisey, the Huffington Post, No Depression, and NPR Music’s Tiny Desk Concert series.<p>This winter, Anna & Elizabeth are beginning a new cycle of work, inspired by ballad singers of the 1930s and 1940s in Vermont and Virginia—the states where they grew up. Spending time in archives, with the families of these singers, and with a director, Anna & Elizabeth with explore connections between place and tradition to develop a new show, a new set of crankies, and a new album inspired by these ballads.<p><strong>7pm doors, 8pm show.

headlining the Glade stage at Glastonbury in 2010, Nick Douwma, better known as Sub Focus, has become one of the most interesting, innovative and important voices working in British electronic music today. Douwma has created compositions for Chase & Status (Flashing Lights) and Example (Kickstarts), remixed The Prodigy, Deadmau5 and Dizzee Rascal, while his own tracks (including Airplane, X-Ray, Rock It, Could This Be Real) have won Sub Focus fans in the form of Zane Lowe, Annie Mac, Grooverider and Mistajam. As a DJ, Douwma has played at every major club night and festival around the world, with the recent EDC in Las Vegas helping to push his US profile exponentially. Since his beginnings as a Jungle DJ, to becoming one of Bass music&#39;s key composers, Sub Focus has cemented his status as a forward-thinking creator with an incredible cannon of compositions. Sub Focuss second solo album, as yet untitled, will further propel him into the realms of both credible notoriety and mainstream success no easy feat. With features from The Alpines, Jess Mills and Kele Okerere (for whom he engineered 2010s The Hunter) initial reactions have been overwhelming. Debuted by Douwma during a guest mix for Mistajams Radio 1 show, first single Out The Blue, featuring Alice Gold, had 250,000 views on YouTube in just one week, and was played by every major Bass DJ you can mention. Mixing Vangelis-like synths with Golds captivating vocals, its a brilliantly paced, deftly constructed D&B smash that will propel the 29 year-old straight back into the charts. Refusing to be stuck within one genre, Sub Focus has ventured far and wide around the world of dance music. If it has bass and a hard hitting hook, hes on it. In the early days when I got into dance music, people were very tribal about what they would and would not listen to, and coming out of that period has been refreshing, he says. I like writing different types of music, so I threw caution to the wind and started putting more varied tempo music out there and the response was great, he says of songs that have ranged far and wide through the world of Dance music. The whole scene is evolving and people are experimenting with different tempos much more now - branching out without fear of the stigma. This is brilliantly reflected on the new album, which effortlessly balances Dubstep, D&B, 90s Jungle, 80s rave, Future Garage and even a steel pan symphony. I like pulling threads from places that maybe aren&#39;t meant to go together, he nods. Im quite a magpie in the way I look at music. While his music has huge mainstream potential, hes wary of playing to the crowd purely for pop star status. Like his contemporaries Nero, Skream & Benga and Chase & Status, he strives to stay true to his musical roots. Wary of doing anything too obvious, he explores the line between being popular without trying to court the commercial. &quot;Trying to strike that balance is one of my main goals - writing underground music with mass appeal.&quot;Beginning his career in the Jungle scene after leaving behind his teenage indie band and being blown away by the Prodigy and Incredible by General Levy, Nick balanced his neophyte beat-making career with Art & Design. After switching to Sound Engineering at London Met, Douwma dropped out to concentrate on music as he quickly found himself one of Drum & Basss leading players. X-Ray was the track that got him noticed, before his seminal remix of the Prodigys Smack My Bitch Up, which allowed him to tour throughout America, Europe and Japan. Signed to the legendary Ram Records, his debut self titled album solidified Sub Focus as a serious player in the world of Electronic music. Since then, as club musics boundaries have altered, his creations have been supported by everyone from Skream to Andy C, Annie Mac to Jack Beats. Late last year, Sub Focus signed a deal to license his second album to Mercury Records, which is due for release in late 2012. Like two of his key influences the Chemical Brothers and Daft Punk, Sub Focus is interested in pushing the boundaries of both the live and recorded experience. For his incredible new stage show he has had a series of exciting gizmos made such as motion sensors which enable him to trigger both sound and light by movement; it needs to be seen to be understood! Within his studio you can expect to see ten types of keyboards from a vintage Roland Juno to the latest Teenage Engineering synthesisers. I&#39;m very deep into the technical side of things, he laughs. With the live show I&#39;m incorporating improvisation, but in an electronic way. I&#39;m using motion sensors, keyboards and computers to play my tracks, all synchronised to a light show based around my disc logo. I want to take the ideas of visualising electronic performance that started with the likes of Jean Michel Jarre and Vangelis and push them a little bit further.This Summer saw Sub Focus perform at a host of major festivals, including Snowbombing, V Festival and Coachella. With the likes of Skrillex winning Grammys, when asked about the future of the industry, Douwma says &#39;It&#39;s a great time to be making this music as it really seems as if there are no limits to where it can go now.&quot;Sub Focuss second solo album, (as yet untitled), will further drive him into the realms of both credible notoriety and mainstream success no easy feat. With features from The Alpines, Jess Mills and Kele Okereke (for whom he engineered 2010s The Hunter) initial reactions have been overwhelming. Debuted by Douwma during a guest mix for Mistajams Radio 1 show, first single Out The Blue, featuring Alice Gold, has had close to a million views on YouTube and has been played by every major Bass DJ you can mention. Mixing Vangelis-like synths with Golds captivating vocals, its a brilliantly paced, deftly constructed D&B smash that propelled him back into the charts. The follow up single to be released from Sub Focus hotly anticipated sophomore album was Tidal Wave featuring Alpines, a stunning track, which hit the airwaves and shot straight to the No.12 spot on the Official UK Chart in early November 2012. With the entire worlds increasing obsession with electronic music, the year 2013 looks very bright for this rising star of Drum & Bass.","modified":"2016-07-28 12:02:05","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"Zachary85","linker":"evdb","name":"Sub Focus","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Sub-Focus?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000100520-5","short_bio":"electronic"}},"title":"Sub Focus","venue_address":"887 W.

Bartók’s quartets highlight an incredible life in music, from his journey uncovering rare folk music of Europe and Northern Africa to his final exodus from Hungary to America on the eve of World War II. This cycle brings his amazing, colorful works to life in vivid performances. Hungarian composer Béla Bartók sought to capture the essence of folk music in his string quartets, and in his travels across Europe and North Africa, he documented hundreds of hours of folk music, meticulously transcribing it. Much of this music had never before been written down, and had instead been passed down from generation to generation in an oral tradition. Of the process of recording Bartók’s string quartets from memory, Chiara cellist Gregory Beaver says, “When we began working on memorizing the Bartók quartets, we found that Bartók’s process worked in reverse almost magically. Many of the devilishly difficult passages in his music became natural when performed without printed music. Through the memorization process, we are able to return Bartók’s music to the realm of the unrecorded folk music he so lovingly captured. We hope that by sharing our performances, Bartók’s remarkable music continues its journey from ear to ear and generation to generation just as the folk music that inspired it.” ProgramBartók: String Quartet No. 2Bartók: String Quartet No. 4Bartók: String Quartet No. 6 Official Site  |  Facebook  |  Twitter  |  YouTube More info coming soon...

The Mule will be joined by Blackberry Smoke, who have evolved from rough-edged club act to arena-ready rock &#39;n&#39; roll juggernauts, while steadily extending and expanding the Southern rock tradition. \n\nNo two Gov’t Mule shows are alike, as the band draws on the more than 300 songs in their repertoire (and often a host of special guests) to create a unique experience each and every time. Their steadily expanding fan base knows that the Mule always has something special waiting for them. \n\nSince Blackberry Smoke’s formation in 2000, the band has never shied away from hard work, playing more than 250 shows a year and building an ever-expanding audience on the strength of its live shows. In addition to winning fans and friends throughout the United States, they&#39;ve toured Europe multiple times and performed for the first time ever in Australia in 2016 to sold-out crowds. Additionally, the band has performed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Conan and toured with and befriended idols such as The Marshall Tucker Band, ZZ Top, Lynyrd Skynyrd and George Jones.\n\nSOMO Concerts ushers in an exciting new era of live music in Sonoma County. Our 3000-seat outdoor venue is the most unique and enjoyable live performance facility in the North Bay.\n\nThe SOMO Village Event Center is solar powered, and features the very latest sound and lighting technology, custom designed for the venue’s outdoor, 1200-square-foot stage. The facility is located an hour’s drive north of San Francisco, in the heart of SOMO Village, the 200-acre, environmentally friendly, planned mixed-use community in Rohnert Park, CA.\n\nTickets available here: http://ticketf.ly/2abPmjs","modified":"2016-07-26 19:01:23","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Gov't Mule and Blackberry Smoke at SOMO Concerts","venue_address":"1100 Valley House Drive","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"Contact05cd5","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/030/803/311-0.png_/govt-mule-and-blackberry-smoke-somo-concerts-11.png","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/030/803/311-0.png_/govt-mule-and-blackberry-smoke-somo-concerts-11.png","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/030/803/311-0.png_/govt-mule-and-blackberry-smoke-somo-concerts-11.png","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/030/803/311-0.png_/govt-mule-and-blackberry-smoke-somo-concerts-11.png","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-07-26 14:55:38","venue_id":"V0-001-008924180-5","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2016-08-31 23:00:00","venue_name":"SOMO Event Center","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/rohnertpark/venues/somo-event-center-/V0-001-008924180-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"OH","postal_code":"44113","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"41.4866","groups":null,"url":"http://cleveland.eventful.com/events/thor-platter-band-/E0-001-094922969-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-094922969-7","privacy":"1","city_name":"Cleveland","link_count":null,"longitude":"-81.6974","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Ohio","start_time":"2016-08-31 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Evocative folk-roots music<p> <br><strong>Soulful country with folk roots</strong><br></p>","modified":"2016-07-27 13:10:56","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Thor Platter Band","venue_address":"1148 Main Avenue","geocode_type":"Zip Code Based GeoCodes","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/030/058/513-0.jpeg_/thor-platter-band-13.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/030/058/513-0.jpeg_/thor-platter-band-13.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/030/058/513-0.jpeg_/thor-platter-band-13.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s2.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/030/058/513-0.jpeg_/thor-platter-band-13.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-07-11 18:04:55","venue_id":"V0-001-008117605-5","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Music Box Supper Club","venue_url":"http://cleveland.eventful.com/venues/music-box-supper-club-/V0-001-008117605-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CT","postal_code":null,"going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"41.3061740","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/newhaven/events/pavo-pavo-/E0-001-094825107-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-094825107-9","privacy":"1","city_name":"New Haven","link_count":null,"longitude":"-72.9300026","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Connecticut","start_time":"2016-08-31 21:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" with Uni Ika Ai, Ports of Spain<br> Pavo Pavo is an experimental pop band from Brooklyn, NY. Their debut record, Young Narrator in the Breakers, will be released on Bella Union in November 2016. The band started writing together while studying music at Yale, and since then its five members have worked closely with indie and classical heavyweights such as Here We Go Magic, Roomful of Teeth, Dave Longstreth, and San Fermin. Stereogum describes their music as weightless pop that sounds like it was beamed down from a utopian future.Young Narrator in the Breakers walks through its songs with symphonic elegance guitar stabs, washed out harmonies, and rumbling synthesizers come and go like guests at a party. The record describes the magic and panic of adult life; a breaker is a wave whose potential energy is being transformed into turbulent kinetic energy. Co-produced by Danny Molad (Lucius) and Sam Cohen (Yellowbirds), it is a romantic record in the tradition of Elephant 6, and a cohesive record in the tradition of Grizzly Bear.

The Royal Family of Reggae, has taken the impressively significant step forward by releasing their upcoming album, Strictly Roots. Guided by sheer acumen and a passionate desire to make their already rich musical legacy even more impactful, Morgan Heritage, after much deliberation and contemplation, triumphantly delivers their latest album exclusively on their very own label CTBC (Cool To Be Conscious) Music Group. Undoubtedly one of contemporary reggae’s most powerful forces on the global stage, the sensational roots reggae quintet, which comprises siblings Peetah  Morgan  (vocals),  Una  Morgan  (keyboard/vocals),  Roy “Gramps” Morgan (keyboard/vocals), Nakhamyah “Lukes” Morgan (rhythm guitar) and Memmalatel “Mr. Mojo” Morgan (percussion/vocals) has embraced the challenges that come with empowerment of this nature. According to Gramps, “Strictly Roots, our 10th studio album is particularly significant. It represents our first album released independent of VP Records, on our very own label CTBC Music Group. VP has been great for the group and we&#39;re grateful for our years with them. We just felt it was time to approach the release of our music differently.&quot; Possessing that unmistakably authentic Morgan Heritage organic roots sound with an expansively eclectic mix that takes it seamlessly into hybrid valleys and mountains, Strictly Roots interestingly pays homage to the elders, while ironically, also blazes the trail towards the exciting future of roots. “We know what our fans want; we know exactly where we want to take them and we know precisely how to get them there,” shrewd lead singer, Peetah Morgan, says confidently of the ground-breaking album which is set for a Spring release. Among the heavyweight co-producers with Morgan Heritage on Strictly Roots are Don Chandler and BBC One/BBC 1Xtra&#39;s Seani B who co-produced the compelling lead single, Perform and Done which is now available on iTunes; Shane C. Brown(Juke Boxx Productions); multiple Grammy nominee, Jason “J-Vibe” Farmer;  French reggae/dancehall production duo MatthieuBost and Jérémie “Bim” Dessus; guitarist Andrew “Simmo” Simpson and DJ Fras. Contributing to the brilliant instrumentation for which a Morgan Heritage album is renowned, is multi-faceted studio and touring drummer, American Gil Sharone, whose DVD, Wicked Beats,  incorporating ska, rocksteady and reggae, won the  Drummie Award in Drum Magazine for “DVD of the Year” in 2011. Adding their vocals to infectious rhythms with empowering and stimulating lyrics are platinum selling Pop/Dancehall phenomenon Shaggy; American reggae and R&B vocalist, J Boog; third generation ambassadors from the Morgan and the Marley families, Jemere Morgan and Jo Mersa Marley; reggae sensation, Chronixx; rock, world and reggae band, Rebelution and Bumble Bee from the American Grammy-nominated pop reggae band SOJA. Like its predecessor, Here Come The Kings, Strictly Roots successfully incorporates R&B and a hint of dancehall, but it goes a step further with this synergy and almost effortlessly fuses a type of roots, pop and dancehall majesty that could only be truly achieved by the Royal Family of Reggae.

African-American artists have always been the trendsetters and the most original to the craft.

The Kattman Radio Network mission is to recognize and honor the artists and industry professionals who have paid their dues, open doors to those who have made a significant contribution to the genre of Southern Soul & Blues & music. Kattman. is announcing a future project, &quot;Hearon Records Nothing But the Blues Concerts,&quot; beginning 2016 to 2020. We are currently setting up venues throughout the United States to begin a joint venture with sponsors, investors, promoters, booking agencies and talent.

Thanks to a body of work that transcends boundaries and renews itself through every generation of fans and music lovers, his legacy continues to live on and will endure for generations to come. <br><br><br><br>Ellington liked to describe those who impressed him as &quot;beyond category.&quot; Because of the unmatched artistic heights to which he soared, no artist deserves this description more than Ellington himself. He is best remembered for the over 3,000 songs that he composed during his lifetime - titles like &quot;It Don&#39;t Mean a Thing if It Ain&#39;t Got That Swing,&quot; &quot;Sophisticated Lady,&quot; &quot;Mood Indigo,&quot; &quot;Solitude,&quot; &quot;In a Mellow Tone,&quot; and &quot;Satin Doll.&quot; When asked what inspired him to write, he replied, &quot;My men and my race are the inspiration of my work. I try to catch the character and mood and feeling of my people.&quot; <br><br>Ellington&#39;s popular compositions set the bar for generations of brilliant jazz, pop, theater, and soundtrack composers to come. While these compositions guarantee his greatness, what makes Duke an iconoclastic genius and an unparalleled visionary are his extended suites. From 1943&#39;s Black, Brown and Beige to 1972&#39;s The Uwis Suite, Ellington used the suite format to give his jazz songs a far more empowering meaning, resonance, and purpose: to exalt, mythologize, and re-contextualize the African-American experience on a grand scale. <br><br><br><br>Duke Ellington was awarded the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 1966. He was later awarded several other prizes, including the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969 and the Legion of Honor by France in 1973 - the highest civilian honors in each country. He died of lung cancer and pneumonia on May 24, 1974, a month after his 75th birthday, and is buried in the Bronx. At his funeral at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Ella Fitzgerald summed up the occasion: &quot;It&#39;s a very sad day ... A genius has passed.&quot; <br><br>Although Ellington himself has passed, his music lives on, as does the orchestra that bears his name. A world-class big band, The Duke Ellington Orchestra continues to perform Duke&#39;s music at venues worldwide, preserving the legacy of one of this country&#39;s greatest national treasures.
