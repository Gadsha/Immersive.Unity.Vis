Hans parents, both practicing classical musicians, instilled an appreciation for music and a strong work ethic in Han very early on, enrolling her in piano lessons at the age of five.Learning the piano as a child was a gift. By the time I became interested in jazz at the age of 14, I had great technical proficiency on my instrument allowing me to focus all my energy on the more sophisticated elements of jazz music. More importantly, I was able to tackle the social equation of learning how to play with others. It takes a lot of time and patience to internalize the essence and heartbeat of jazz.The 22-year-olds connection to jazz began at the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts where she met and was mentored by drummer Bill Wysaske, who produced CRIME ZONE and has also become the musical director of her trio. Han shares her LACHSA alumni status with several major players in the entertainment industry such as Josh Groban, Jenna Elfman, Christina Milian and GRAMMY Award-nominated jazz pianist and composer Gerald Clayton. After a three-week stint at UCLA, Han immediately began her professional piano career at 17-years-old; a step that Han believes gives her an overall edge against many players her age. Because I never received training from a formal jazz piano teacher, most of my musical perspective actually came from interacting with a professional drummer when I was just a youngling, trying to hang on for dear life. I think that experience has given me a unique edge which informs the heavily percussive elements of my playing. CRIME ZONE features Hans in-the-groove working trio which includes Wysaske on drums and Edwin Livingston on bass. Shes also enlisted the considerable talents of guest players tenor-saxophonist Walter Smith III and trumpeter Brian Swartz for the album. Recently signed to Mack Avenue Records after her independently produced 2015 album,The Richard Rodgers Songbook, Han has seized this opportunity: the pianists upcoming release highlights a powerful statement that is a mix of respect and knowledge of the past, combining an exciting and innovative vision for her musical future. CRIME ZONE opens with Another Kind of Right, a tune Han wrote in tribute to the Freddie Hubbard tune, One of Another Kind. Han states, the bridge is a very tough, swaggering Freddie Hubbard style of playing. Bill Wysaske arranged and curated a lot of what goes on there. It was his idea to transition from acoustic piano to Rhodes at my solo, giving the music a breath of fresh air. Its definitely inspired by that post-bop, pre-fusion sound straight out of the late 60s and early 70s. The expansive title track featuring the swinging sax accompaniment of Smith III, which winds to a stoop midway through before restarting with a lively interplay between Han, exemplifies much of the style and aesthetic thrust that the pianist wants her debut to embody. This record is really meant to be a statement about being rebellious but within the tradition, Han explains. Its provocative and fresh in its own way, while still having one foot in the past and honoring the jazz tradition. The title, CRIME ZONE, reinforces how I hope to brand myself as an artist, which in the end is being a provocateur of creative music.The title track demonstrates the futuristic visual and aesthetic element that Han has brought to the zeitgeist surrounding CRIME ZONE, one that draws its inspiration from films like Blade Runner and the 1988 Japanese animated film, Akira.Not only does jazz capture the rebellious spirit of cyberpunk culture, says Han, but also the forward-thinking essence of science fiction. These traits are important to my musical philosophy as well as my style as an artist and person.The up-tempo Southern Rebellion is a Han original in C minor that features the pianists speed and stamina. Its a tune she wrote which was focused on challenging herself to not think like a piano player. Han explains, I had been listening to a lot of early 70s Elvin Jones with Dave Liebman and Steve Grossman, where the harmony is more free since there isnt any piano to dictate the harmony. That concept heavily guided my melodic inspiration for Southern Rebellion, while my tough post-bop piano influences like Kenny Kirkland and McCoy Tyner informed its rhythmic angularity and aggressiveness. One of the things that sets Han apart from most of her contemporaries is her skill on the always distinctive Fender Rhodes. As the title suggests, another Han original Grvy, she playfully taps into that super tasty, laid back Rhodes flavor, one that recalls the playing of Bob James, but also nods again to Hans musical education. Its an instrument that has always been a part of the consciousness of my piano heroes, like Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea. I wouldnt say it has a pop vibe but its definitely more mainstream, says Han. She acknowledges the influence of another one of her heroes, Joe Henderson, by covering his Shade of Jade which was originally recorded on his Mode For Joe album. Han explains, The concept for the entire arrangement is actually based on just four bars of Joe Chambers polyrhythmic comping on the head of the original recording.On CRIME ZONE, Han has staked her claim as a fresh new voice on jazz piano, one whose sense of visual style might even draw audiences who normally wouldnt listen to straight-ahead jazz.Even though jazz is meant to be fearless in its creative limits, I strongly believe in preserving the musical foundation, Han states. As a new artist, I want to show that it is possible to create infinite fresh ideas without having to deconstruct the building blocks of the jazz language. To me, that language is universal.","modified":"2018-08-29 04:06:11","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Connie Han Trio","venue_address":"5377 N College Avenue","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-08-29 04:06:11","venue_id":"V0-001-000764186-9","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Jazz Kitchen","venue_url":"http://indianapolis.eventful.com/venues/jazz-kitchen-/V0-001-000764186-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Chicago","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"MO","postal_code":"64111","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"39.0576051","groups":null,"url":"http://kansascity.eventful.com/events/dj-peter-anthony-aka-coughman-/E0-001-116696136-8?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-116696136-8","privacy":"1","city_name":"Kansas City","link_count":null,"longitude":"-94.5909778","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Missouri","start_time":"2018-09-28 22:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <br> ","modified":"2018-07-31 23:24:56","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"dj peter anthony AKA COUGHMAN","venue_address":"3810 Broadway","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-07-31 23:24:56","venue_id":"V0-001-006110020-3","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"miniBar","venue_url":"http://kansascity.eventful.com/venues/minibar-/V0-001-006110020-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Chicago","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"TX","postal_code":"77047","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"29.5980737","groups":null,"url":"http://houston.eventful.com/events/zo-carmen-rodgers-pianoamicrophone-intimate-per-/E0-001-116938025-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-116938025-4","privacy":"1","city_name":"Houston","link_count":null,"longitude":"-95.3957454","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Texas","start_time":"2018-09-28 19:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Zo! + Carmen Rodgers &quot;Piano & A Microphone&quot; Intimate Performance in HOUSTONGreen Mill Social ClubDoors: 7p | Show: 8p You may be used to seeing them with a full band, but this performance will give you a chance to witness them delivering their songs completely “stripped down” to their core featuring only piano and vocals.  Zo! on Piano.Carmen on Vocals.Intimate Venues.Playing JAMS.Join us!

Exploring broken relationships, sordid characters, and unfortunate events, Tragic Jack delivers original Rock/Pop songs performed with conviction and groove. \n\n&quot;...a predominantly piano-driven sound that combines characteristics of Amsler’s indie rock and Hull’s blues, with straightforward song structures, bouncy piano and guitar progressions and Hull’s emphatic, Jagger-esque vocals.&quot; Daily Nebraskan \n\nThe project was born in the summer of 2013, when Hull and Amsler began writing together on Sunday afternoons at Silver Street Studio in Ashland, Nebraska. Amsler, fresh off a one-time reunion show with his former major label band The Millions, was interested in developing new material and getting back on the stage. Hull, owner of Silver Street Records, was keen to advance years of songwriting and production into a live band with a big sound. \n\n&quot;Their balanced pop-rock melodies ride through keys, guitar and cello. Hull’s vocals are rich and blues centered, with lyrics full of romance and conviction. &quot; - KZUM 89.3 \n\nOver the next three years and many Sunday afternoons, Hull and Amsler slowly crafted a diverse catalog of original songs flavored by the Rock, Soul, Gospel, Jazz, Indie, and Pop influences of the writing duo. \n\n“...their dynamic range really sets them apart.

GUYS REDUCED TO $20 BEFORE 12AM. ARRIVE EARLY!! Hudson Terrace Rooftop is a beautiful BI-LEVEL nightclub with Hudson River views! With two floors of stylish and trendy decor it is one of the most frequented nightclubs in NYC.  Looking for a little Miami on the Hudson? This rooftop lounge comes complete with off-white leather couches, pink drinks, a remixed eighties soundtrack, and views of cruise ships parked in the harbor. Perched in the no man’s land between midtown and the West Side Highway, the wood-paneled space is a nice spot to watch a sunset, with floor-to-ceiling windows facing Jersey and a bird’s-eye view of the Intrepid. But once the sun goes down, be prepared for a heavy dose of South Beach—think men who leave hair-gel marks on the upholstery and women with exposed back tattoos. To complete the experience, order some tuna tartar and a pitcher of mojitos and stake out a table facing the water. And if it (gasp!) happens to rain, you can head to the more demure salon area on the floor below or wait for the muscled bartenders to erect a tent and keep you dry. Overlooking the Hudson River in Midtown Manhattan, Hudson Terrace is located on 621 West 46th Street, New York, NY, 10036. It is about a 15-minute walk from the Times Square 42nd Street subway stop. Upon entering Hudson Terrace, guests go to the second floor where they are escorted to the main Salon. Hand-hewn wooden beams from vintage vessels have been repurposed to construct the edges, in a fusion of the old and the new. The Salon features state-of-the-art audio, visual, and lighting capabilities. The private Garden Terrace on the Salon level is ideal for hosting brunch, outdoor meetings, or moonlit dinner parties. Where Hudson Terrace shines, however, is its rooftop lounge, featuring surround sound, programmable lighting, and large projection-screening capabilities. We have TWO HUGE Dance floors, Retractable Rooftop with Amazing Music & water views.

Coinciding with the 45th anniversary of Pink Floyds prolific album, the Dogtown Presenters Series (DPS) seeks to bring together a diverse crowd of music lovers and dance lovers for an unforgettable theater experience. From the artistic vision of Dogtowns Artistic & Executive Director and RVA Dance Collectives Co-Founder and Director, Jess Burgess, Dark Side of the Moon will explore the ideas found in Pink Floyds music and lyrics through a story of movement. Through physical dance exploration, Dark Side of the Moon discusses the philosophical and physical elements of existence that can lead to a person&#39;s insanity and feelings of an unfulfilled life. The iconic album is a cautionary tale in two parts: the first half describing this unfulfilled life, the second half consisting of individual songs depicting detrimental aspects of society. The philosophical ideas in the second half of the album reflect the madness that is the root cause of the elements explored in the first half of the album. Dark Side of the Moons choreography pushes dancers with driven physicality, embodying the linear existence to which we conform in society through part one, while letting disorder and madness take over in the second half, ultimately leading to still one conclusion: &quot;All that&#39;s to come and everything under the sun is in tune, but the sun is eclipsed by the moon.&quot; Humanitys infinite potential to persist and survive in the face of adversity is represented by the life-giving sun; yet, the sun is still eclipsed by the moon. This years DPS is more than a dance performance; it is a collaboration of talented Richmond artists. This one-of-a-kind collaboration features contemporary dance company, RVA Dance Collective with special guests Dogwood Dance Project and RADAR, merging three of Richmonds independent dance companies for one exceptional, large-scale performance supported by an elaborate, moving set and props. The performance will be visually stunning thanks to its creative, masterful set, currently under construction by local visual artist and photographer, Mike Keeling. Keeling is a resident artist at Crossroads Arts Center, and frequently has gallery installations at ArtWorks Galleries and Studios, as well as Dogtown Dance Theatre. Keelings constructions are vital to the storytelling component of this evening-length dance work, including dancers manipulating a 10-foot slide throughout the entirety of the work, alongside a human-sized, revolving hamster wheel resting on a 12-foot mountain depicting the eponymous moon. The Dogtown Presenters Series is intended to be a fully immersive experience, showing dance can be accessible to everyone, regardless of their prior experiences or relationship with dance. You dont have to enjoy modern dance to enjoy Dark Side of the Moon, and you dont have to enjoy Dark Side of the Moon to enjoy this truly unique showcase of amazing RVA modern dance talent, says choreographer, Jess Burgess. The visual components of this years Presenters Series will be stunning and unlike anything RVA has ever seen. The work of Mike Keeling is the perfect compliment to these talented dancers and the album. We are so excited for September.<br> <br> \n","modified":"2018-07-24 06:11:05","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Dogtown Presenter's Series: Dark Side of the Moon","venue_address":"109 W. 15th Street, #205","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":"on various days","calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-07-24 06:11:04","venue_id":"V0-001-000641418-9","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2018-09-28 20:00:00","venue_name":"Dogtown Dance Theater","venue_url":"http://richmond.eventful.com/venues/dogtown-dance-theater-/V0-001-000641418-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Chicago","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"MS","postal_code":"39180","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"32.3494244","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/vicksburg/events/doug-allen-nash-johnny-cas-/E0-001-109379107-8@2018092820?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-109379107-8@2018092820","privacy":"1","city_name":"Vicksburg","link_count":null,"longitude":"-90.8825338","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Mississippi","start_time":"2018-09-28 20:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":null,"modified":"2018-07-20 06:16:48","venue_display":"0","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Doug Allen Nash- Johnny Cash Tribute: American Icon","venue_address":"Washington St.","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":"on various days","calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2017-12-02 11:40:58","venue_id":"V0-001-000003016-1","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Postal code 39180, US","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/vicksburg/venues/postal-code-39180-us-/V0-001-000003016-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Denver","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NM","postal_code":"87501","going_count":null,"all_day":"2","latitude":"35.682265","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/santafe/events/ronald-roybal-/E0-001-116224009-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-116224009-0","privacy":"1","city_name":"Santa Fe","link_count":null,"longitude":"-105.946389","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New Mexico","start_time":"2018-07-14 00:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <br> Spanish Classical Guitar and Native Flute<br><br>Every Friday and Saturday Evening 7-9 <br><br>In the Amaya Lounge <br>visit our <a href=\"http:///\" rel=\"nofollow\">website</a><br> sources: santafe.org, Santa Fean Magazine ","modified":"2018-07-14 17:28:05","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Ronald Roybal","venue_address":"1501 Paseo de Peralta","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-07-14 06:36:37","venue_id":"V0-001-012254724-4","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2018-12-29 00:00:00","venue_name":"Hotel Santa Fe","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/santafe/venues/hotel-santa-fe-/V0-001-012254724-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Los_Angeles","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NV","postal_code":"89109","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"36.1099696","groups":null,"url":"http://lasvegas.eventful.com/events/beatleshow-/E0-001-115986742-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-115986742-6","privacy":"1","city_name":"Las Vegas","link_count":null,"longitude":"-115.1700646","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Nevada","start_time":"2018-07-28 17:30:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Critics say Beatleshow is as close as you can get to the real deal.
