This band has no problem throwing down the Rock. The live show sounds huge and is definitely a &quot;Party&quot;. While the Jam Band Sound is slightly present in this band, they will play some country &quot;Zeppelin&quot; with that Bluegrass twist, then let the blues ride until last call. If you like vintage gear these fuckers have shit you never seen: it looks like a garage sale on stage. The amp selection is sick and they play the shit out of them.

We experience real joy when we play these songs, and people feel that, and they respond in kind, regardless of whether they understand the words or know the ‘right’ dance moves. It was the same for each us at one point when we first heard Luis Gonzaga or Gilberto Gil—we were provoked and then captured by the music, and we feel honored to be able to offer our own interpretations of it.” <br><br><b>Please note:</b> Forró Night with En Canto and dance class included with Brazilian dance instructor <b>Erika Magno</b>. <br><br> Learn the basics or try some new steps with Erika then enjoy dancing to live music with En Canto! <br><br><a href=\"http://www.encantobrazil.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Website</a><br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/encantobrasil\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook</a><br><a href=\"https://twitter.com/encantobrazil\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twitter</a><br><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/encantobrazil/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Instagram</a><br><br><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/1862347843858890/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Facebook Event</a><br><br><i>Please note: Tickets do not guarantee seating during shows at the Royal Room.

21+MetaphoniaFormed in 2014 in Boone, NC, Metaphonia is the Prog-Funk brainchild of bassist/vocalist Alex Golden and keyboardist Mike Runyon.

With a current lineup also featuring Blake Bostain (trumpet), John Portela (saxophone), and Erik Brandt (guitar), Metaphonia boasts some of the finest and most diverse talents in the high country.
