You may have read “Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil”  a non-fiction murder mystery novel by John Berendt. We’ll bring those intriguing Savannah stories to life when you visit the Mercer House. How about the infamous Greek Revival haunted home at 432 Abercorn Street , one of Savannah’s most controversial and most haunted houses? If you’re just looking to whet your appetite with haunted stories, or want to dive full on in more paranormal activity, the Sixth Sense Savannah Ghost Tour has got you covered and will astonish with endearing to scary stories, start to finish!

This young archer has hadthe incomprehensible luck to fall into crew with his idols, bereared by their best and given some of their most guardedmusical secrets, then hoisted to a platform to blare hisprodigious beats from places where most creators can onlydream of being.Born in Tehran, Iran, Ardalan possesses a peculiar, freshperspective on music genesis without even trying. His mixes,remixes and dubs are known for their sass, energy andwickedly wry samples that snap like a wet towel to the face,but his original records are where his efforts shine, like thosereleased with Justin Martin —“Mr. Spock,” a 2010 partyanthem charted by Diplo and Jesse Rose, “LEZGO,” chartedby Dog Blood (Skrillex and Boyz Noise) and “Function”, the2015 banger that keeps giving — as well as two of his ownEP’s that were released on Dirtybird, “The Yeah / No” and“Thunderdad”. It is no wonder he has been given the nod byeveryone, from Papa Dirtybird himself (Claude VonStroke)and A-Trak, to those who are charting his remixes, like MayaJane Coles, Audiojack, and Riva Starr.The greatest strength in Ardy’s music is his ability to whip outhits that work equally well from the dankest basements to themost opulent dance-floors; sounds that satisfy those withdiverse tastes who can unite under his single agenda ofhaving a good time.Support By:HBK (Perfect Driver/Sleazy G/Mos Geygst)https://soundcloud.com/hbkmusic1 Burger Alert  https://soundcloud.com/burgeralertPandad https://soundcloud.com/pandad Sweezy https://soundcloud.com/swezzzey Hosted By:PRESSURE  ::Drink Specials::2 Free kegs | First come first serve$1 drinks till 11pm,$2 till 12am, $3 from 12-2am. ::Fun & Stuff::3 N64&#39;s & 1 Super Nintendo w/ access to Mario Kart 64, Super Smash Bros, Mortal Kombat I, II, & III, Street fighter II, NFL Blitz, Golden Eye, Pokemon Stadium, NBA Jam, Madden, Killer Instinct, WCW/ NWA Revenge. 3 Classic movies playing on the big screen projector AGES: 18+ | NO REFUNDS | ALL SALES FINAL ","modified":"2016-08-29 05:54:15","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Techyes @ The Standard ft.

He then left the audio reels untouched in the back of his West Village loft, to be rediscovered over forty years later.<br><br>Now, Ezra Bookstein has selected sixty-one of those interviews and published them for the first time in a new book, The Smith Tapes. Here are compelling never-before-published interviews with some of the biggest names in music, film, culture, and politics in the 1960s and 70s, including John Lennon & Yoko Ono, Dustin Hoffman, Mick Jagger, Frank Zappa, Andy Warhol, Carole King, Pete Townshend, Sly Stone, George Harrison, Jane Fonda, Eric Clapton, Lou Reed, Dennis Hopper, Dick Gregory, Jack Nicholson, James Taylor, Abbie Hoffman, Janis Joplin, and many more.  <br><br>At BookCourt, Ezra Bookstein will discuss the importance of these tapes and share rare audio from the interviews. Books will be available for purchase.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s rare that an interviewer helps to shape his era as much as his best-known subjects, but that was the case with Howard Smith. These interviews--with writers, rock stars, filmmakers, politicians--have lost none of their immediacy. Decades later, they remain gripping, essential reading.&quot; --Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor, Rolling Stone <p>\n\nMORE INFO: <br>Website: <a href=\"http://bookcourt.com/events/ezra-bookstein\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bookcourt.com/events/ezra-bookstein</a> <br>Email:   <a href=\"mailto:publicity@papress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">publicity@papress.com</a> <br>Phone:   212-995-9620 \n\nSubmitted by the <a href=\"http://www.fullcalendar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>FullCalendar Event Promotion Service</strong></a></p>","modified":"2016-08-26 14:34:05","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Smith Tapes book event & listening party: rare classic rock interviews","venue_address":"163 Court Street Brooklyn","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"FullCalendar","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2016-08-26 14:34:05","venue_id":"V0-001-001470320-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2016-08-31 21:00:00","venue_name":"BookCourt","venue_url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/bookcourt-/V0-001-001470320-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Denver","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CO","postal_code":"81302","going_count":null,"all_day":"2","latitude":"37.2754","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/durango/events/musicians-wanted-/E0-001-093395920-1?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-093395920-1","privacy":"1","city_name":"Durango","link_count":null,"longitude":"-107.88","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Colorado","start_time":"2016-06-01 00:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":"  White Rabbit Books & Curiosities is seeking folk and classical musicians to perform during &quot;Saturdays on the River&quot;, a weekly music starting June 4th through the end of August.
