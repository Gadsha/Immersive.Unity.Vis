Something else happened, too. The rise of Swedes in music scenes around the globe gained huge traction. From Avicii and Swedish House Mafia to Lykke Li and Robyn, the flag for Scandinavian genius flew. But one (or –more accurately – three) names were missing: those of Peter Moren, Bjorn Yttling and John Eriksson.</p></p></p></p></p>","modified":"2016-08-27 11:12:20","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"columbiarecords","linker":"evdb","name":"Peter Bjorn And John","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Peter-Bjorn-And-John?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000010825-9","short_bio":"Pop / Indie / New Wave"}},"title":"Peter Bjorn and John","venue_address":"925 E Pike Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/271/659-9.jpeg_/peter-bjorn-and-john-59.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/004/271/659-9.jpeg_/peter-bjorn-and-john-59.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/271/659-9.jpeg_/peter-bjorn-and-john-59.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/004/271/659-9.jpeg_/peter-bjorn-and-john-59.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-08-06 06:52:40","venue_id":"V0-001-001461613-5","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Neumos","venue_url":"http://seattle.eventful.com/venues/neumos-/V0-001-001461613-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Los_Angeles","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CA","postal_code":"92704","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"33.6998449","groups":null,"url":"http://orangecounty.eventful.com/events/ja-rule-and-ashanti-/E0-001-095093977-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-095093977-2","privacy":"1","city_name":"Santa Ana","link_count":null,"longitude":"-117.9194283","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"California","start_time":"2016-08-31 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":null,"modified":"2016-07-21 08:01:06","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":[{"creator":"scorpion_kjf","linker":"evdb","name":"Ja Rule","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Ja-Rule?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000039256-6","short_bio":"rapper/hiphop/R&B"},{"creator":"CooleErica","linker":"evdb","name":"Ashanti","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Ashanti?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000014945-0","short_bio":"R&B"}]},"title":"Ja Rule and Ashanti","venue_address":"3503 South Harbor Boulevard","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":{"user":{"username":"Tonishae047a"}},"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/390/147-1.jpg_/ja-rule-47.jpg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/000/390/147-1.jpg_/ja-rule-47.jpg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/390/147-1.jpg_/ja-rule-47.jpg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/000/390/147-1.jpg_/ja-rule-47.jpg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-07-19 18:50:36","venue_id":"V0-001-005452885-4","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Observatory","venue_url":"http://orangecounty.eventful.com/venues/the-observatory-/V0-001-005452885-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Los_Angeles","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CA","postal_code":"94110","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"37.7605650","groups":null,"url":"http://sanfrancisco.eventful.com/events/julia-holter-/E0-001-092159203-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-092159203-0","privacy":"1","city_name":"San Francisco","link_count":null,"longitude":"-122.4211880","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"California","start_time":"2016-08-31 21:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" with White Magic<br> Have You In My Wilderness is Julia Holters most intimate album yet, a collection of radiant ballads. Her follow-up to 2013s widely celebrated Loud City Song explores love, trust, and power in human relationships. While love songs are familiar fodder in pop music, Holter manages to stay fascinatingly oblique and enigmatic on her new album.Have You in My Wilderness is also Holters most sonically intimate album. Here, she and producer Cole Marsden Greif-Neill lift her voice out of the layers of smeared, hazy effects, putting her vocals front and center in the mix. The result is strikingit sounds as if Holter is singing right in your ear. It sounds clear and vivid, but also disarmingly personal. The focused warm sound and instrumentation dense strings, subtle synth pads adds to the effect.Like Holters previous albums, Have You in My Wilderness is multi-layered and texturally rich, featuring an array of electronic and acoustic instruments played by an ensemble of gifted Los Angeles musicians.Have You In My Wilderness deals with dark themes, but it also features some of the most sublime and transcendent music Holter has ever written. The ten songs on the album are shimmering and dreamlike, wandering the liminal space between the conscious and the subconscious.","modified":"2016-07-12

Derek E. Miller (songwriter, guitarist, producer) and Alexis Krauss (vocals). The two met and formed in 2008, when Miller was waiting tables on Alexis and her mother at a neighborhood Brazilian restaurant. When Miller mentioned that he was looking for a female vocalist for a new musical project, Krauss&#39;s mother immediately volunteered her daughter.Sleigh Bells&#39; unique sound is likely the result of Miller and Krauss&#39;s contrasting musical backgrounds; Miller was formerly the guitarist for the post-hardcore band Poison the Well and Krauss was a member of the teen pop group RubyBlue as a teenager. After steadily gaining popularity throughout 2009, Sleigh Bells signed to M.I.A.&#39;s label N.E.E.T. in Spring 2010.In 2010, Sleigh Bells released their debut full-length album entitled Treats. The album&#39;s immediate popularity and the band&#39;s reputation as an energetic live act have helped solidify the duo&#39;s widespread popularity. Amidst blown-out drum beats, fuzzed guitars and synth-pop sensibilities, Krauss balances each song with a voice that is both forceful and elegant.

This prolific artist (n Will Toledo) comes to Matador having already crafted an 11-album catalog of staggering depth, all self-released on Bandcamp, which has gained him an obsessive following and over 25,000 downloads - all without the muscle of a manager, label, agent, or publicist - until now.Car Seat Headrest began in 2010 in Will Toledo&#39;s hometown of Leesburg, Virginia. Needing a place of solitude (and soundproofing) where he could record vocals undisturbed, a 17-year-old Toledo set up shop in the family car. Toledo&#39;s catalogue is sharp, literary, and culturally omnivorous as it touches upon youth and death, love and depression, drunken parties and 2nd century theologians. Ever surprising, his lyrical imagery ranges from playful to sexually frank to sorrowful, often within the same song.After relocating to the Seattle suburbs in 2014, Toledo assembled a lineup with bassist Ethan Ives and drummer Andrew Katz. Teens of Style is the first Car Seat Headrest album recorded with a full band, and the sound is vibrant and powerful, with a wide stylistic range.On Teens of Style, Toledo has taken material from the first three years of the band&#39;s existence and reworked it to generate some of the most realized arrangements to date. Drawing material from 3 (2010), My Back Is Killing Me Baby (2011), and Monomania (2012), Teens of Style provides a concise overview of the band&#39;s many sonic and emotional facets, with the songs ranging from electronic psychedelia to punky anthems to melancholic acoustic numbers.","modified":"2016-06-10 10:21:30","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Car Seat Headrest","venue_address":"241 South 500 East","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/016/351/360-2.jpeg_/car-seat-headrest-60.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/016/351/360-2.jpeg_/car-seat-headrest-60.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/016/351/360-2.jpeg_/car-seat-headrest-60.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/016/351/360-2.jpeg_/car-seat-headrest-60.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-05-22 06:41:37","venue_id":"V0-001-000917530-6","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Urban Lounge","venue_url":"http://saltlakecity.eventful.com/venues/urban-lounge-/V0-001-000917530-6?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NY","postal_code":"11590","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"40.75817522683059","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/bruce-hornsby-/E0-001-093425018-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-093425018-9","privacy":"1","city_name":"Westbury","link_count":null,"longitude":"-73.58751930174827","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New York","start_time":"2016-08-31 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":"  ","modified":"2016-07-08 13:20:26","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"chuck","linker":"evdb","name":"Bruce Hornsby","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Bruce-Hornsby?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000009014-5","short_bio":"Pop / Adult Contemporary / Light"}},"title":"Bruce Hornsby","venue_address":"250 Post Avenue","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/258/047-1.jpeg_/bruce-hornsby-47.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/004/258/047-1.jpeg_/bruce-hornsby-47.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/004/258/047-1.jpeg_/bruce-hornsby-47.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/004/258/047-1.jpeg_/bruce-hornsby-47.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-05-14 23:59:16","venue_id":"V0-001-007208283-3","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Space at Westbury","venue_url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/the-space-at-westbury-/V0-001-007208283-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NJ","postal_code":"07960","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"40.7942710","groups":null,"url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/events/chicago-band-/E0-001-092840540-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-092840540-5","privacy":"1","city_name":"Morristown","link_count":null,"longitude":"-74.4779600","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New Jersey","start_time":"2016-08-31 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":null,"modified":"2016-04-23 11:05:22","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Chicago -

The Washington Post called Fitz and The Tantrums live show captivatingly crazy and Rolling Stone praised the band for its irrepressible energy: hopped-up rhythms, shout-it-out choruses, and hooted background vocals in a review of More Than Just a Dream. The New York Times noted, Their debut effort, Pickin Up the Pieces (Dangerbird), and follow-up, More Than Just a Dream (Elektra), burst with danceable hooks. The Los Angeles Times said, Fitzunderstands what makes a good songAnd co-vocalist Noelle Scaggs charisma overflows. More Than Just a Dream, which has racked up over 76 million album streams to date, contained the RIAA Gold-certified singles The Walker (which was tapped for the 2014 OSCAR ad campaign featuring Ellen DeGeneres and a cast of dancers) and Out Of My League. Both songs were multi-format hits, topping Billboards Alternative Songs chart at #1 and placing in the Top 5 at Triple A radio and in the Top 15 at Hot AC. Fitz and The Tantrums natural exuberance permeates their new self-titled album, which celebrates walking to the beat of your own drum. Lead singer, Michael Fitzpatrick, says of new record, Weve always tried to push ourselves at every turn. For our third album, we continued to challenge ourselves, taking care not to write the same record again. Turn It Up, Fitz exhorts at the top of album opener and first single HandClap. The horn-and-beats fueled track captures the exhilarating sense of promise and danger that a night out and a new romance hold. The staccato Complicated paints a relationship thats packed with both chemistry and conflict and bursts into an unexpected cheer. Echo and otherworldly keyboards make Tricky an intoxicating dance-floor anthem and a warning to any future lover, while A Place For Us, the album closer, encapsulates the bands belief that there is a place in the world for each of us to belong, regardless of our differences.Overall, this is an album about desire the desire for intimacy, for sex, for acceptance on your own terms and the struggle not to compromise, explains Fitz. Fitz and The Tantrums was recorded in the bands hometown of Los Angeles. Jesse Shatkin (Sia, Matt & Kim) produced eight of the albums eleven tracks.

Nov 2011 by Jono Ma and Gabriel Winterfield.It all starts with the single &quot;Come Save Me&quot;. A celebration of love and loss, lifted by human harmonies only to be sliced apart by the sharp contemporary programming of the song acting as dagger to the tale. This juxtaposition of voice and electronics being a signature of Jagwar Ma.Their collaboration started in 2010 at a performance by FLRL, the Sydney based kraut-experiment that was &quot;a band without members&quot; and a stage of revolving musicians. Their musical history already well known to each other at the time, Jono from the band Lost Valentinos and Gabriel from Ghostwood.Those shared stages at FLRL shows gave way to studio jams and home recordings, radio frequency manipulation, TR808 patterns, MPCs loops, vintage amps and a treasured 7 inch collection. Jagwar found a soul in and amongst all that electricity. Described as sounding like J-Dilla playing Primal Scream covering the Beatles.In Australia &quot;Come Save Me&quot; has been embraced by Triple J who spun it to the #1 most played spot on the station. In the UK it was released through a new 7&#39;s label started by two A&Rs from the legendary XL Records. In the US the song finds high rotation on airwaves of the lauded KCRW and the bands signs with the Windish Agency.Currently the band is ensconced in a castle in France bouncing beats through the dungeons, singing through its hallowed hallways and breathing life into their debut album for the summer of 2012. The first ever festival appearance in Australia for Jagwar Ma will be the 2013 Big Day Out!","modified":"2016-08-28 00:58:12","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"usernamesaredumb","linker":"evdb","name":"Jagwar Ma","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/performers/jagwar-ma-/P0-001-014195300-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-014195300-2","short_bio":"Australian psychedelic/dance band formed in Sydney in 2011."}},"title":"Jagwar Ma","venue_address":"628 Divisadero Street","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/016/252/279-1.jpeg_/jagwar-ma-79.jpeg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/016/252/279-1.jpeg_/jagwar-ma-79.jpeg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/016/252/279-1.jpeg_/jagwar-ma-79.jpeg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s4.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/016/252/279-1.jpeg_/jagwar-ma-79.jpeg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-05-18 09:43:56","venue_id":"V0-001-001144444-9","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"The Independent","venue_url":"http://sanfrancisco.eventful.com/venues/the-independent-/V0-001-001144444-9?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Anchorage","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"AK","postal_code":null,"going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"61.5574600","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/palmer/events/thousand-foot-crutch-/E0-001-093023549-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-093023549-2","privacy":"1","city_name":"Palmer","link_count":null,"longitude":"-149.1892550","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Alaska","start_time":"2016-08-31 19:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":null,"modified":"2016-04-28 14:57:50","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":{"performer":{"creator":"Dryve","linker":"evdb","name":"Thousand Foot Krutch","url":"http://concerts.eventful.com/Thousand-Foot-Krutch?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"P0-001-000003949-0","short_bio":"Rock"}},"title":"Thousand Foot Crutch","venue_address":"Mile 40","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":{"small":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/174/452-6.jpg_/thousand-foot-krutch-52.jpg","height":"48"},"width":"48","caption":null,"medium":{"width":"128","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/medium/I0-001/000/174/452-6.jpg_/thousand-foot-krutch-52.jpg","height":"128"},"url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/small/I0-001/000/174/452-6.jpg_/thousand-foot-krutch-52.jpg","thumb":{"width":"48","url":"http://s1.evcdn.com/images/thumb/I0-001/000/174/452-6.jpg_/thousand-foot-krutch-52.jpg","height":"48"},"height":"48"},"created":"2016-04-28 14:57:50","venue_id":"V0-001-000460687-4","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Alaska State Fairgrounds","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/palmer/venues/alaska-state-fairgrounds-/V0-001-000460687-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Denver","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"NM","postal_code":"87501","going_count":null,"all_day":"2","latitude":"35.6869","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/santafe/events/osteria-dassisi-piano-lounge-tucker-binkley-/E0-001-096059016-5?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-096059016-5","privacy":"1","city_name":"Santa Fe","link_count":null,"longitude":"-105.937","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"New Mexico","start_time":"2016-08-27 00:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <br> Join singer pianist Tucker Binkley in the Piano Lounge at Osteria d&#39;Assisi Ristorante Italiano.

He then left the audio reels untouched in the back of his West Village loft, to be rediscovered over forty years later.<br><br>Now, Ezra Bookstein has selected sixty-one of those interviews and published them for the first time in a new book, The Smith Tapes. Here are compelling never-before-published interviews with some of the biggest names in music, film, culture, and politics in the 1960s and 70s, including John Lennon & Yoko Ono, Dustin Hoffman, Mick Jagger, Frank Zappa, Andy Warhol, Carole King, Pete Townshend, Sly Stone, George Harrison, Jane Fonda, Eric Clapton, Lou Reed, Dennis Hopper, Dick Gregory, Jack Nicholson, James Taylor, Abbie Hoffman, Janis Joplin, and many more.  <br><br>At BookCourt, Ezra Bookstein will discuss the importance of these tapes and share rare audio from the interviews. Books will be available for purchase.<br><br>&quot;It&#39;s rare that an interviewer helps to shape his era as much as his best-known subjects, but that was the case with Howard Smith. These interviews--with writers, rock stars, filmmakers, politicians--have lost none of their immediacy. Decades later, they remain gripping, essential reading.&quot; --Anthony DeCurtis, contributing editor, Rolling Stone <p>\n\nMORE INFO: <br>Website: <a href=\"http://bookcourt.com/events/ezra-bookstein\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://bookcourt.com/events/ezra-bookstein</a> <br>Email:   <a href=\"mailto:publicity@papress.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">publicity@papress.com</a> <br>Phone:   212-995-9620 \n\nSubmitted by the <a href=\"http://www.fullcalendar.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><strong>FullCalendar Event Promotion Service</strong></a></p>","modified":"2016-08-26 14:34:05","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Smith Tapes book event & listening party: rare classic rock interviews","venue_address":"163 Court Street Brooklyn","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"FullCalendar","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2016-08-26 14:34:05","venue_id":"V0-001-001470320-0","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2016-08-31 21:00:00","venue_name":"BookCourt","venue_url":"http://newyorkcity.eventful.com/venues/bookcourt-/V0-001-001470320-0?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/New_York","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"FL","postal_code":null,"going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"26.0108","groups":null,"url":"http://miami.eventful.com/events/karaoke-game-night-slight-wednesday-food-music-/E0-001-096001147-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-096001147-3","privacy":"1","city_name":"Hollywood","link_count":null,"longitude":"-80.1497","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"Florida","start_time":"2016-08-31 19:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" Island 360 presents: Slight Wednesdays @ Hot Peppers Restaurant After a long day at work come grab a DRINK and enjoy some of the best Caribbean FOOD in Hollywood, FL accompanied by great MUSIC, GAMES and GOOD VIBES!

First and foremost, the band is astonishingly young, with frontwoman/guitarist Clementine Creevy still not old enough to vote and bassist Sean Redman just barely above the drinking age. They are now rounded out by new members Sasami Ashworth on keyboard and guitar and Tabor Allen on drums. And then there&#39;s the fact that the band&#39;s debut cassette was released by California&#39;s current kings of DIY power pop and garage rock, Burger Records. So even if you know nothing else about the LA-based band, you know that they&#39;re young and that they&#39;re a part of the thriving underground community of stripped-down jubilant rock n&#39; roll. But if you&#39;re envisioning a bunch of awkward, hyperactive kids bouncing around in their parent&#39;s basement, consider the fact that the band has been championed and photographed by French fashion designer Hedi Slimane of Saint Laurent Paris. Slimane even commissioned the band to score his fall/winter 2014 Paris show. The result was &quot;Had Ten Dollaz&quot;, a song that captures Cherry Glazerr&#39;s knack for dualities: sultry and virulent, sophisticated and casual, laid back and bombastic, playful and deliberate.
