This album is clear evidence of what Im talking about. Throughout it, you will become thrilled by both his complete mastery of his instrument and his beautiful, sensitive reflections. Im especially excited by Vonetta, which was written by Earl, because it truly exemplifies the kind of musician he is one with a great sense of rhythm, harmony and feel I know that you will get as much pleasure out of listening to this album as I have had working with Earl Right on, Earl Klugh! George Benson, on Klughs self-titled debut Earl Klugh (1976) Since GRAMMY-winner Earl Klugh released his inaugural album in 1976, the Detroit-born master of the acoustic-classical guitar has become one of the most imitated icons of the instrument. He has released over 40 records, 24 of which have been on Billboards top-10 list of jazz albums and 6 of which have made it to the No. 1 slot. Klughs recordings have received 13 Grammy nominations (including one for his latest release, HandPicked) and his collaboration with pianist Bob James, One on One, walked away with the 1980 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album. In 2016, Earl celebrates the 40th Anniversary of his debut album Earl Klugh (1976, Blue Note Records) with a very special catalogue of shows, highlighting selections from over 250 original compositions and featuring Klughs favorite standards, influences and collaborations from throughout his illustrious career. Ive been so fortunate to be able to create the music that Ive wanted to create, and work with some of the greatest artists of our time, says Klugh. Its hard to believe its been 40 years since that first record! You know, this one really caught me by surprise, reflects Klugh. When I look up, time has just flown by. But, Im still here, and Im still playing! Im just so pleased and happy to have the career Ive had so far. Ive met so many wonderful people, in and out of the musical realm. Im living a really wonderful life where you just have to pinch yourself sometimes, because there are so many things to be grateful for. www.EarlKlugh.com<br> <br> Hello all, Here are some additional details for the wine event: The vineyard will be open for our guest to check in starting at 2:00 pm.
