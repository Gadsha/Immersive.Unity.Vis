It&#39;s kind of like an open stage but pre-planned, with assigned playing slots each day. HSGA members get priority on all showcase stages, non-members will be assigned a slot to play once all members have been scheduled. (Join HSGA today for only $30!) ALL styles are welcome, but you will hear a lot of Hawaiian music. This is typically not a pedal steel showcase. The art of Hawaiian-style steel playing on electric lap steels, resonator guitars, and acoustic instruments is the main focus of our event and organization. You will be asked what time slot you&#39;d like to play during checkout on this website. We want you to share your music! <b>What is the Luau?</b> A luau will be held on Saturday night with a Polynesian-style dinner, cash bar, and show - $50 per person. Excellent food, and Hawaiian entertainment. <b>I need Hotel Reservations, is that included?</b> Hotel reservations must be made separately. They can be made by calling the Fort Collins Hilton at (970) 482-2626 - mention the HSGA Hawaiian Festival for special block room rates. OR reserve your rooms online <a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/HSGA2018-HiltonRes\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Hilton HSGA reservations. </a> <b>What is the Playing Schedule?</b> Schedule posted at <a href=\"http://hsga.org/festival2018.htm#players\" rel=\"nofollow\">HSGA.org website.</a> Please note that you will be asked for your stage time slot preferences during checkout on this website. We encourage you to play! We want you to share your music. Playing slots are assigned on a first-come-first-served basis. We&#39;ll try and take your preferences into account. All stage playing slots are planned and scheduled by the festival committee. If you want to do a set on stage during the weekend, please sign up as you purchase your ticket here (you&#39;ll see the sign up form during the checkout), or check the HSGA website for sign up information that you can print and mail it. A paper registration form will be mailed to all members in the next newsletter. All players will have 25 minutes to perform, and must bring at least two sets of charts for the backup musicians. You will need to round up your own backup folks from volunteers at the festival. Don&#39;t worry - there will be many folks willing to play guitar, or uke or bass for you. Or you can bring your own backup folks. AND, all performers MUST purchase either a day or weekend pass. <b>What AIRPORT do I fly into?</b> DIA in Denver is the fly-to location. Many options exist out of DIA for transport to Ft. Collins. There are shuttle services, and rental cars. We recommend <a href=\"http://www.greenrideco.com\" rel=\"nofollow\">Green Ride out of Ft. Collins.</a> <b>Can I join HSGA?</b> Please consider becoming a member if you are not. Visit <a href=\"http://www.hsga.org\" rel=\"nofollow\">HSGA.org</a> to sign up. Membership gets you a regular quarterly newsletter, priority for stage time at Ft. Collins, and really nice price breaks at our biennial convention event in Honolulu. Next one in 2019. <b>What to Bring?</b> The stages will have backline amps, so bring your instrument, cables to plug in, tuner, charts for backup players, your good self and a smile. Colorado in the early Fall can have dramatic weather changes, but it&#39;s usually warm during the day, and cold at night.

Fred is a brilliant pianist and composer. His music is beautifully melodic, harmonically delicious and memorable. Check out the link below. In addition to jazz, Fred counts as his influences European impressionism and the Beatles. What&#39;s not to love? Fred has worked with Ralph Towner, Larry Coryell, Lyle Mays, Steve Rodby, Paul Wertico and ... you name it. This will mark Freds first Studio5 appearance. He will be joined by three other outstanding Chicago musicians, guitarist Dave Onderdonk, bassist Jon Paul, and drummer, Larry Beers. Come hear this fine quartet up close in our intimate setting. You will be happier for it. We&#39;ll be recording this performance for Chicago Jazz Live on WDCB, so you&#39;ll be part of the studio audience! Cash bar, light snacks, free parking right outside.

rel=\"nofollow\"></a><br><em>All tickets are general admission. Purchasing a ticket does not guarantee a seat.</em><br>  <br><br> Many  musicians  claim  that  they  “grew  up  in  the  church,”  but  for  Robert  Randolph that  is literally  the  case.  The  renowned  pedal  steel  guitarist,  vocalist  and  songwriter led  such  a cloistered  childhood  and  adolescence  that  he  heard  no  secular  music  while  growing  up.  If  it wasn’t  being  played  inside  of  the  House  of  God  Church  in  Orange,  New  Jersey—quite  often by  Robert  and  members  of  his  own  family,  who  upheld  a  long  but  little  known  gospel  music tradition  called  sacred  steel—Randolph  simply  didn’t  know  it  existed.<br><br> Which  makes  it  all  the more  remarkable  that  the  leader  of  Robert  Randolph  and  the  Family  Band—whose  label debut  for  Sony  Masterworks,  Got  Soul,  will  be  released  on  Feb.  17,  2017—is  today  an inspiration  to  the  likes  of  Eric  Clapton,  Carlos  Santana  and  Derek  Trucks,  all  of  whom  have played  with  him  and  studied  his  technique.  It  wasn’t  until  he  was  out  of  his  teens  that Randolph  broke  away  from  the  confines  of  his social  and  musical  conditioning  and  discovered rock,  funk, soul,  jazz and  the  jam  band  scene,  soon  forging  his  own  sound  by  fusing elements  of  those  genres.<br><br> “It was all church music.  It  was  a  movement  within  our  church and  that’s  all  we  used  to  do,”  says  Randolph  of the  sacred  steel  music  he  played  at  the time,  music  whose association  with  his  church  stretches  back  to  the  1920s.  Once  Randolph began  to  discover  other  forms  of  music,  he  saw  how  they  were  all  connected,  and  was eager  to  find  his  own  place.  “All music is related.  Gospel is the same as blues,” he says. “The  only thing  that  changes  is  in  hardcore  gospel  people  are  singing  about  God  and  Jesus and  in  the  blues  people  are  singing  about  ‘my  baby  left  me ‘and  whiskey.  When  we  first started  out,  guys  really  weren’t  allowed  to  leave  the  church.  I was the one that stepped out and started this thing.  My  dad  would  say,  ‘Why  do  you  come  home  smelling  like  beer  and cigarettes? ’‘Well,  we  just  got  done  playing  some  smoky  club  till  2  a.m.! ‘It was all foreign and different.<br><br> ”By  the  early  2000s,  Randolph  had  begun  applying  his  dazzling  steel  guitar technique  to  secular music,  and  from  that  grew  the  Family  Band.  The group’s  sound  was  so different  than  anything  else  around  that  they  were soon  packing  New  York  City  clubs.  Their first  album,  2002’s  Live  at  the  Wetlands,  was  recorded  at  the  now  defunct  jam  band  haven, and  was  followed  by  four  studio  albums and  another  live  set,  each  widening  the  band’s audience—they’ve  long  been  regulars  on  the  festival  circuit—and  broadening  their  stylistic range  as  well.<br><br> “Things  happened really  fast,”  Randolph—named  one  of the  100  Greatest Guitarists  of  All  Time by  Rolling  Stone—says  now.  “When  I  look  back  on  that  time,  to  be honest, I  had  no  idea  what  the  hell  we  were  doing.  We’d get  told,  ‘You  guys  are  going  on tour  with  Eric  Clapton.’  ‘Oh, OK.’  I thought,  this  guy  must  not  have  a  clue  who  I  am  but  the first  time  I  met  him  we  talked  for  about  an  hour  and  played  music  backstage.<br><br> ”The  Family Band’s  improvisational  skills  quickly  made  them  mega-popular  among  the  jam-band  crowd, but  for  Randolph  and  his  band  mates,  what  they  were  doing  was  just  an  extension  of  what they’d  always  done.  “The  jam  band  scene  has  that  name  but  it’s  really a  true  music  art  form  scene  where  you  can  just  be  who  you  are,”  Randolph  says.  “We  fit in  that  category  in  some  sense  but  the  jam  band  scene  itself  has  changed  a  lot  since  that time.  I’ve  grown  to  like  songs  and  I  like  to  jam  within  the  song.”<br><br> ”On  Got  Soul—which features  guest  artists  Anthony  Hamilton,  Darius  Rucker,  Cory  Henry—Robert  Randolph  and the  Family  Band  walk  that line  deftly,  displaying  their  virtuosity  within  the  context  of  a  dozen smartly  crafted  tunes.  “I like both playing live and recording,” says Randolph.  “The  thing about  a  record  is  you  get  a  chance  to  rehearse  parts  and  fine-tune  things.  But  if  you  look at most  great  music  artists—people  like  Stevie  Wonder—the  song  is  totally  different  from  the show.  When  you’re  in  the  studio,  it’s  hard  to  improvise  without  an  audience.  But for  us, well, we’ve  been  playing  in  front  of  audiences  our  whole  lives.”<br><br><br><strong>*Seating Disclaimer*</strong><br><br> The Redstone Room at River Music Experience is a standing room only concert venue.

Tickets are $20 adv/$25 door and will go on sale tomorrow (Sept 5th). When Shim Moore first began writing solo music, a piece of early career advice stuck with him. He recalls, Somebody once told me, When youre making music, the difference between good and great is blood. If you bleed on a record, people are going to hear it. If you dont, people are going to hear it too. Truth is, Shims blood courses through every song hes ever written and recorded. Millions of fans worldwide connected to his songwriting, spirit, and soul across four full-length albums from the RIAA platinum-certified Sick Puppieswhich he founded in 1997. Following his split from the group during 2015, the Australia-born and Los Angeles-based singer, songwriter, and producer did what he does best: write. I lost my band, a lot of my finances, and most importantly, my identity, he admits. I wasnt going to stop though. I had to find a new identity and the songs to go with it. It was a whole rebirth. It couldnt be some acoustic shit or a retread of what Ive already done. It had to be fucking amazing. After a couple of failed attempts at collaborating again, the universe delivered me this ultimatum, If you dont do this yourself, its never going to get done. Just do it. Back at square one, Shim transformed the bedroom of his L.A. apartment into a makeshift studio and bought $4,000-worth of equipment from Guitar Center. Borrowing amps and guitars from friends, he personally produced and engineered what would become his independent solo debut in under 44 daysbarely making the deadline to return the gear. He transferred the chaos around him into the boldest anthems of his career introduced by the 2018 debut single Hallelujah. On the track, bluesy clean guitar cries out before snapping into a gospel-style chantCan I get an Amen or a Hallelujah?carried by a full choir. It culminates on a wild guitar solo before dive bombing back towards the hard-hitting hook once more. You can create the life you want regardless of the perceived obstacles, he goes on. Hallelujah is all about digging yourself out and starting the work. I didnt have a specific projection of where this was going. I had no idea what my destination would be, but I knew I had to get moving. Elsewhere on the record, Our Time serves as an empowering affirmation set to a soundtrack of orchestral swells and unbreakable distortion, while Fearless encourages the superhero in all of us with a seismic chant. Shim adds, Thats a conversation Ill have with my son someday. In the end, this body of work represents the artist at his most poignant and powerful, and ready to tear up stages around the globe. Music should sound exciting at all times, he leaves off. If it excites you, you wont shut it off. I wanted to make a record that didnt let up. This is my sound. Its real. Its empowering. Its who I am. Theres a lot of blood on it.<br> <br> \n","modified":"2018-09-07 03:04:57","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Shim Live at Koot's","venue_address":"2435 Spenard Road","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-09-07 03:04:57","venue_id":"V0-001-001388324-4","tz_city":null,"stop_time":"2018-09-29 01:00:00","venue_name":"Chilkoot Charlies","venue_url":"http://anchorage.eventful.com/venues/chilkoot-charlies-/V0-001-001388324-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Los_Angeles","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CA","postal_code":"93238","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"35.7553210","groups":null,"url":"http://eventful.com/kernville/events/60-grit-band-/E0-001-113554365-4?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-113554365-4","privacy":"1","city_name":"Kernville","link_count":null,"longitude":"-118.4256500","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"California","start_time":"2018-09-28 13:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" We’ll be playing the Kern River Rock n Blues Fest VIP Party from 1-4pm on Friday 9/28! $20 gets you admission, a BBQ meal, a beer, and a seat for 60 Grit!","modified":"2018-09-04 13:59:13","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"The 60 Grit Band","venue_address":"101 Piute Dr","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2018-04-05 14:35:30","venue_id":"V0-001-006150453-3","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"Bud Light Kern River Rock n' Blues Fest presented by Rip Cat Records","venue_url":"http://eventful.com/kernville/venues/bud-light-kern-river-rock-n-blues-fest-presente-/V0-001-006150453-3?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"},{"watching_count":null,"olson_path":"America/Los_Angeles","calendar_count":null,"comment_count":null,"region_abbr":"CA","postal_code":"92802","going_count":null,"all_day":"0","latitude":"33.8107","groups":null,"url":"http://orangecounty.eventful.com/events/reggae-fyah-fridays-/E0-001-117710493-2?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic","id":"E0-001-117710493-2","privacy":"1","city_name":"Anaheim","link_count":null,"longitude":"-117.917","country_name":"United States","country_abbr":"USA","region_name":"California","start_time":"2018-09-28 20:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":"Reggae & BBQ!
