TA$C!ONE started playing various instruments at a young age including the piano and the guitar. He comes from a long line of musicians with family members having played alongside acts like Frank Sinatra, Van Morrison, Tina Tuner, Elton John, Eric Clapton, and more. In High School he started film editing and music production without a clue as to what he was really doing. It wasn&#39;t until his college years that he buckled down, and hit production really hard, but he hasn&#39;t looked back since. A relative newcomer to the scene, T$! has already garnered support from industry leading producers, blogs, and labels. Following the success of his Beatport charting single &quot;Real Street&quot;, a collaboration with industry heavy hitter Prismo, he&#39;s continued to strike while the iron is hot with big remixes and originals.

Beyond the Bars teachers will premiere the tracks at the heart of a month-long exhibition of audio the student musicians created.  You’ll hear performances, practice sessions leading up to concerts, and some music created especially for you.  Special for this opening, teachers will illuminate the sounds with commentary.  Music Department librarians will also feature a corresponding collection of print music and audiorecordings in response, and there might even be a special guest. Though this audio exhibition (which also closes the curtain on this summer’s collaborative Juvenile in Justice series) will live in the Music Department for anyone to listen to until September 4th, make sure to catch this opening to listen to the teachers and the students in this particularly timely soundtrack.  We hope it will shine a light on the faces of youth incarceration in the U.S, and inspire a dialogue about this institution&#39;s place in our twenty-first century communities. Beyond the Bars is a 501(c)3 organization dedicated to bringing musical education and instruments to incarcerated youth in Philadelphia.  Using instruments to create a safe space in which students can jam, practice, and learn how to play songs as well as its music theory elements and techniques, Beyond the Bars brings skills and the opportunity of creative expression to youths who find themselves victims of the criminal justice system.
