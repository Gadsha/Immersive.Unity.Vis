Come on out to see all of these incredible musicians shredding faces off! Desiree&#39; Bassett: Throughout the years, she has performed with many outstanding and renowned musicians including Living Colour, Andy Aledort, Geraldo Velez, Jeff Baxter “Skunk”, members of the Allman Brothers Band, Sammy Hagar, Ted Nugent Marshall Tucker Band, Foghat, Barry Goudreau (formerly of the band Boston), and many more. With the explosion of the social media world, Desiree quickly became world-known through videos of her performances on MySpace, Facebook and YouTube. Desiree’ currently has 3 albums out (Power & Force, Power & Force II and A Bit Above) and has gone through a few tours: -Cirque du Soleil’s Michael Jackson the IMMORTAL World Tour (2011-2014) which featured some of Michael Jackson’s original band members and has gone around 27 different countries in 141 cities with over 500 performances, hitting the box offices of being the 7th highest grossing tour of over $374 million. -Blue Moon Tour with world renowned drummer Stacey Lamont Sydnor and world famous bassist Linley Marthe that took place in Europe in 4 different countries. -Jane Zhang&#39;s Bang The World Concert that featured two concerts in Jane’s hometown Chengdu, China. One concert featuring a very electrifying show of dance, pop, and electronic and another concert Jane Zhang and Friends that performed with a 90 piece orchestra and had featured world famous artists such as Chris Botti and John Legend. -The Legacy Tour featuring William Hall that is a totally dedicated, emotionally powerful driven show that tributes to the all time favorite Michael Jackson. The tour took place in Australia from May – July of 2016 and August – October of 2017 and Germany from September – October of 2016 and is still currently touring around the world. Currently, Desiree’ still continues to tour around the world while on her time off works on her 4th album and performs shows with her band Desiree&#39; & the Time Machine, a power trio that features her on lead guitar and vocals, Robert Gottfried on drums and Bob Laramie on bass, and a side project she occasionally performs with known as Siksay Band. Shadow Eden: Shadow Eden creates music that dazzles with virtuosity, ignites the senses, and pushes boundaries. Shadow Eden culminates the heralded talents of founding members David Mercado & drummer Kenny Lane, who joined by bassist extraordinaire Randy Coven in 2011 quickly became a mainstay of the Northeast circuit. Shadow Eden&#39;s self titled, self-financed and promoted ALL instrumental release, entered the regular rotation of national college radio stations entering the top 40 on the CMJ charts !! Shadow Eden began work on it&#39;s release in the Summer of 2013. &quot;Perpetual Motion,&quot; was completed in March of 2014 and soon thereafter the band began making preparations for a Summer release, which was tragically derailed by the untimely passing of Randy Coven. Confronted by overwhelming odds and pressure, in the face of the pending release, the band held auditions for a replacement. A fan of both Shadow Eden & The Mark Wood Experience introduced them to Mark Wood&#39;s bass player, Paul Ranieri. Ranieri, a masterful musician & Bass player, was the perfect fit for the musical pedigree of Shadow Eden, officially joining the band in July of 2014. Since it&#39;s founding in 2009, Shadow Eden has enjoyed great fortune, being propelled to the forefront of their genre by sheer musical prowess & determination, earning them the respect of their contemporaries and gaining them legions of new fans. In the words of The Metal Fields Kerb Vater, &quot; People who are interested in good instrumental work should give Shadow Eden a listen....&quot; A new chapter now begins....Dave, Paul & Claudio Joe Stump: Joe Stump (born September 18 , 1960) is an American guitarist and composer. He plays neo-classical metal, in a style similar to that of Yngwie Malmsteen. He has released albums with his band, Reign of Terror and as a solo artist. Stump is a professional shredder, and Guitar One Magazine voted him 6th position among the Top 10 fastest shredders of all time. Stump has taught for many years at the Berklee College of Music in Boston.
