For nine days from August 24 to September 2, 1921, in Logan County, West Virginia, some 15,000 armed coal miners confronted 2,000 lawmen and strikebreakers, called the Logan Defenders. The &quot;Defenders&quot; were backed by coal mine operators during an attempt by the miners to unionize the southwestern West Virginia coalfields. The battle ended after approximately one million rounds were fired, and the United States Army intervened by presidential order. This fictionalized account of a little known historical event will put you in the heart of the war. Today the battle still goes on over that very mountain.","modified":"2018-08-18 06:51:04","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Battle of Blair Mountain","venue_address":"518 W.

The songs that weave themselves into the fabric of listeners&#39; lives are usually the ones in which an artist lays her soul bare for the world to hear. Struthers&#39; current release Champion, is built on these kinds of songs. The 13-song collection written with her band the Party Line, is the follow-up to 2015&#39;s Wake, which earned Struthers acclaim from major outlets like NPR Music, Rolling Stone Country, and &quot;Fresh Air&quot; and their Live show is full to the brim with stellar musicianship, unexpected arrangements that blur the lines between folk, roots, and rock, and an audible sense that everyone in the room is having a damn good time. When not on the road, the band’s been in-studio recording their next release.","modified":"2018-08-17

regularly in Cincinnati/Dayton/Columbus. We play mostly &quot;dancey rock&quot; music. But we also have a country section, a hip hop section, a classic rock section, and a straight dance section. We cover artists like: Maroon 5, Dave Matthews, Kid Rock, Sublime.........to Kenny Chesney, Big & Rich, Keith Urban, Rascall Flatts........to Snoop Dogg, Fifty Cent, Naughty By Nature, House of Pain, Vanilla Ice.......to Justin Timberlake, George Michael.......to Van Halen, Def Leppard, Bonjovi, Skynyrd, Tom Petty, Cheap Trick. We like to say we have something for everyone and if you haven&#39;t heard one ya like so far, stay tuned....WE GOT YA COVERED. We are 100% reliable and do not cancel shows at the last minute. We travel with a full PA and lights that are very fast to setup and teardown. All lights are LED based and draw very little power. The sound system can be scaled down to be as quiet as needed, or the whole system can be setup to cover a large outdoor venue. WE GOT YA COVERED. Thanks for looking and listening! :-)  ","modified":"2017-12-20 10:06:41","venue_display":"1","tz_country":null,"performers":null,"title":"Spungewurthy","venue_address":"65 Millard Dr","geocode_type":"EVDB Geocoder","tz_olson_path":null,"recur_string":null,"calendars":null,"owner":"evdb","going":null,"country_abbr2":"US","image":null,"created":"2017-12-20 10:06:41","venue_id":"V0-001-005926253-7","tz_city":null,"stop_time":null,"venue_name":"JD Legends Entertainment Complex","venue_url":"http://cincinnati.eventful.com/venues/jd-legends-entertainment-complex-/V0-001-005926253-7?utm_source=apis&utm_medium=apim&utm_campaign=apic"}]}}
