We aim to create and maintain A harmonious space which couples Sustainable food production and education with a community-centered haven for music and the arts. By these means we hope to cultivate an environment which strengthens the POSITIVE energy that flows through us all. Hosted on the site of Willowsong Farmstead, is a 20-acre property in Sidney, Michigan (about 1 hour northeast of Grand Rapids, northwest of lansing and mount pleasant). It boasts a lovely pond, plenty of aged willows (gee... wonder where the name came from... wink, wink) , apple trees, a large organic garden and plenty of fresh air. Hosting the annual Willowsong Music Festival and owned by The Raby Family. Days Festivities: Gates open at 2:00pm on Friday the 28th - attendees will want to arrive early to choose their campsite and set up shop before the festivities begin. Camping and parking are included at no charge. No ground fires or fireworks allowed on premises, we will have a community fire for everyone. Please reach out in advance with an email to willowsongfarm@gmail.com for special accommodations like limited mobility or RV parking.  A new band will take the stage approximately every hour until the last band begins at 10:00pm. There will be plenty of space to enjoy the live music as well as food vendors, local artists and festival merchandise. We hope to have an hourly raffle for neat stuff like Willowsong Swag and Artist Merch. After the last stage show, campers can gather around the rather large fir pit for some relaxing acoustic campfire tunes. The event will proceed rain or shine with enough tent space for everyone to cozy up in the event of foul weather calamities. End of the Evening After a fun filled day, camping is strongly encouraged. Don&#39;t drink and drive! Please stay tuned! More details will roll out as the date approaches. Like our sponsors, food vendors, art vendors, festival activities and bands! Can&#39;t wait to announce as we are receiving many inquiries already. Hope to see you all in September!

Detroit&#39;s oldest performance artist SATORI CIRCUS will celebrate his 30th Anniversary with performances from a 30year oeuvre of avant-garde musical theatre. On Friday and Saturday, September 28th & 29th, 2018, come celebrate this performance career milestone for two performances at The Tangent Gallery/Hastings Street Ballroom. These eclectic performances have graced the art galleries, black box spaces, streets, churches, and stages big and small in the Detroit area and throughout the U.S. SATORI CIRCUS was conceived as a one-man orchestration early in 1988, coming to fruition the fall of that year. Hard to define, this artist is not clown and not mime. Just a ball of energy, this life-force started inhabiting a myriad of characters from man to woman, to child, to things. Along with music and pantomime, film elements and words (spoken or sung), slapstick and movement and cloaked behind clown white and various facial accents, SATORI CIRCUS world came to life wherever the stage. He celebrates a performance career that has exceeded 25+ self-written/produced stage shows that included performances in 1515 Broadway, Detroit Artist Market, Scarab Club, College of Creative Studies, Detroit Institute for Arts, St. Albertus Church (a 146year old historic church), Oakland University/MeadowBrook, on Americas Got Talent and a 25 anniversary show at the Detroit Institute of Arts/Detroit Film Theatre. It has also taken him across the country to perform in Los Angeles, Chicago, Las Vegas, Albuquerque, Pittsburgh and New York. SATORI CIRCUS creative director and main performer, Russell A. Taylor has been on the scene for 38 years. Starting back in 1980 as lead singer for the rock band, The Nasties, and then as co-founder of alt-art-punk band, Fugitive Poetry in 1983. SATORI CIRCUS spoke, sung and moved for the first time at the Michigan Gallery in 1988 and found a home at the original black box-art theatre space, 1515 Broadway, Detroit. Thru the years he has been recognized for his work and has received accolades from local and national press. He won a Detroit Music Award for &quot;Outstanding Live Performance,&quot; in 1994 and in 2012. His photo has graced the cover of the Metro Times and he has been called easily the Best Performance Art Group Detroit has produced. It should be seen if only to witness a New Direction in Art. - Detroit Free Press and A love for the absurd, SATORI CIRCUS is a singularly uncanny theatre-going experience thats a little bit Performance Art and a little bit Rock Opera. - Metro Times. The 30th Anniversary show will feature some of the vignettes from his past shows such as EQUILBRIUM, MOSES:39, Child-Proof, Funy As Hell, Twilight Barks, 63mins (of random balance), poems we tell ourselves and a most recent performance art piece, Stroke. There will even be a couple surprise selections from the myriad of guest appearances SATORI CIRCUS as made throughout the years that include Theatre Bizarre (Det.), DAMNED (Det.), Dirty Show (Det.), Michigan Burlesque Festival (Det.), Atrocity (Pittsburgh), WIZBANG (Cleveland & Det.), Performance Art Festival (Cleveland) and the Erotic Poetry & Music Festival (Det.).

I didn’t have a good answer when I asked myself, ‘Why am I still doing this?’ So I walked away. I had to figure out what was next.” For Hoge, what came next was a quest to reclaim the joy and the magic that had drawn him to music in the first place. He let his band go and hit the road for roughly a year of solo shows, crisscrossing the country by himself with just a guitar and a keyboard. He felt rejuvenated by the freedom and began writing material that reenergized him, that made him feel like a kid falling in love with rock and roll all over again. Those songs ignited a dormant flame somewhere deep within Hoge’s soul, and now they form the bulk of Anchors, his strongest and most nuanced album to date.  “All the solo work made me fall back in love with the process and really inspired me from a writing perspective,” says Hoge. “I was so excited when it was time to record this album because I didn’t have any parameters that I had to stay inside anymore. I could reach out to anyone I wanted and put together a band that could play these songs in a way that just felt cool and natural, like we used to do in my garage back when I was a teenager.” Hoge’s teenage garage band years were spent in Franklin, TN, but his music career didn’t begin in earnest until he moved roughly twenty miles up the road to Nashville. Starting with the release of his acclaimed 2001 debut, Carousel, Hoge established himself as a masterful songwriter and performer as well as a critical favorite, with Rolling Stone comparing him to Bob Seger and John Mellencamp and NPR praising his “sharp, smart, passionate rock ‘n’ roll that seems to exist out of time.” Hoge built up a loyal fanbase the old fashioned way, maintaining a steady studio output and a relentless touring schedule of more than 200 shows a year, including bills with the likes of My Morning Jacket, the Black Crowes, and Drive-By Truckers, in addition to festival slots from Bonnaroo to Austin City Limits. Then, in 2012, Hoge found himself suddenly thrust into the spotlight when the Eli Young Band hit #1 on the Billboard Country chart with their recording of his song “Even If It Breaks Your Heart.” The single went Platinum, earning Hoge coveted nominations at the CMA, ACM, and GRAMMY Awards, where the track was up for Country Song of the Year. The wider world took notice of what those paying attention to Hoge had known for a decade, and soon he was performing everywhere from the Grand Ole Opry to The Late Show with David Letterman, his music was soundtracking a high-profile Chevy truck campaign, and he’d signed a major publishing deal. “All of the sudden, people were coming and offering me money to be a songwriter,” reflects Hoge. “I hadn’t had a regular paycheck in fifteen years at that point, and suddenly I was a ‘paid songwriter.’ It was an incredible opportunity, and I did that for four years while I continued to tour and make my own records. I learned a lot of valuable things and wrote some songs that I really loved, but it was a very different kind of writing. I felt like I was working for somebody else.” So, as he’s always done throughout his career, Hoge took a gamble on himself and left behind the security and comfort of the familiar in order to pursue the kind of art that moved and inspired him. The result is Anchors, an album that blends elements of literate folk, vintage country, and heartland rock into a passionate, genre-busting masterpiece. Recorded with an all-star band comprised of drummer Jerry Roe (Emmylou Harris & Rodney Crowell, Darius Rucker), bassist Dominic Davis (Jack White, Wanda Jackson), and guitarists Brad Rice (Son Volt, Ryan Adams) and Thom Donovan (Lapush, Ruby Amanfu), the album is a prime showcase for Hoge’s soaring, gritty vocals, as well as his remarkable gift for crafting complex characters with real emotional depth and plainspoken profundity. “There’s some seeds you plant that never grow,” Hoge sings on loping album opener “The Reckoning.” It’s a beautiful, bittersweet introduction to a record that grapples with the messy challenges of adulthood and takes an unflinching look at the ways in which we persevere (or don’t) through hard times. On “This Grand Charade,” Hoge paints a portrait of a crumbling marriage going through the motions to keep up appearances, while “Angel’s Wings” channels classic country in the search for one more chance to turn things around, and the spare, piano-driven “Cold Night In Santa Fe” laments that “it ain’t the knowing that it’s over / it’s the watching it slip away” that causes the most pain. Hoge’s a happily married man with two kids of his own these days, though, so he knows that time doesn’t inherently doom all lovers. “Ain’t nothing we can’t fix / Ain’t no broken trust / Ain’t no great divide between the two of us ” he sings in harmony with special guest Sheryl Crow on “Little Bit Of Rust. “I’d always wanted a female vocal for this song because I felt like the ‘we’ in the chorus is important,” says Hoge. “Nobody fixes a relationship on their own. I felt like it deserved this strong female presence, and Sheryl’s just one of the greatest singers I’ve ever heard. Having her on the track breathed a whole new life into the song, and it’s one of my favorite things I’ve ever done.” While the album has its fair share of heavy moments, Hoge isn’t afraid to mine the more optimistic and playful veins of his creativity, too. He lets his mischievous side shine on the lustful “This Ain’t An Original Sin,” gets romantic on the Traveling Wilburys-esque “Baby’s Eyes” (a co-write with Brendan Benson), and reconnects with the innocence and excitement of his early days on “Seventeen,” a track inspired by his own kids’ exploits in the garage. “My boys are six and ten, and they started a band with their friend,” explains Hoge. “I was sitting around one day during my period of deep doubt, and then I heard these three pre-teens in my damn garage thinking they can save the world with rock and roll. It was amazing. All of the sudden you remember the feeling of going to band practice and playing with your friends and making sure that you’ve got your jean jacket on just right so you can talk to the girl at the movie theater and try to get her to come to your show. You remember you do it because you love it and it feels right.” That’s the notion that carries album closer “Young As We Will Ever Be” into the sunset. It’s an ode to the present, to living in the moment, to seeing the splendor in the right now, challenging as it may be. It’s easy to get jaded or lose inspiration in this world when the going gets tough, and it’s even easier to take the good times for granted, only recognizing them for what they are once they’re in the rearview mirror. If there’s one takeaway from Anchors, though, it’s that hard times come and hard times go, but love and art can sustain you through both if you let them. The road you end up on and the stops you make along the way may not be the ones you’d always imagined, but true happiness belongs to those who learn to find fulfillment in the journey rather than the destination. “Am I as far as I want to go?” Hoge asks himself out loud. “No. Am I further than I ever imagined being at seventeen? F*** yeah. There’s some beauty in that.”  Website FAQs Please click here for a detailed FAQ.
